The study's lead researchers dug into the economic impact of three of Trump's campaign promises: mass deportations, tariffs, and eroding Fed independence.\\n\\nThroughout the course of a prospective Trump term, undermining the central bank's independence would lead to $304 billion in economic losses, the study found.\\n\\nWhile Trump has not specified exactly how he would interfere in the Fed, the researchers assumed he is successful and pressured the bank to jack up economic growth when conducting their study. They found that such action would result in lower GDP and higher inflation through 2040.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nBusiness Insider spoke with one of the study's authors, Warwick McKibbin, a senior fellow at PIIE. He said that initially, GDP and employment would rise, but that inflation and input costs would go up soon after. Eventually, capital would flow out of the US, causing the dollar to fall in value.\\n\\n\\\"It's like the party at the front and the hangover after four years,\\\" McKibbin said over the phone.\\n\\nHe said that by 2028, inflation would be built into the system at an additional 2% per year and the economy would shrink.\\n\\nDomestic producers would bear the brunt of the consequences due to rising input costs. As domestic goods get more expensive, workers' purchasing power would go down, McKibbin said. All the while, the researchers argue that investors would get spooked by the politicized Fed and start directing their capital to other countries starting around 2026. Production would shift to other parts of the world, including China, the study found.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\\"Ironically, it means the rest of the world gets this free lunch because all that capital that would have gone into building America's future growth will now get invested somewhere else, mainly Canada, Mexico, and China, as well as Australia,\\\" McKibbin told Business Insider. Though Trump promises an America First economic agenda, McKibbin said that taking control of the Fed would get him the opposite results.\\n\\nAccording to the study, the economy would hit a low point in 2028 and begin rebounding.\\n\\nRelated stories\\n\\n\\\"But not back to where you were,\\\" McKibbin said.\\n\\nHe said the capital stock would feel the impact for a long time, and full recovery could take decades.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nWhile Trump's specific ideas about the Fed remain murky, some of his allies are quietly drafting plans on how to strip the central bank of independence, the Wall Street Journal reported. The 10-page manifesto apparently includes policy shifts and suggests the president should have a direct say over interest rates. Sources told the Journal the group thinks Trump should be able to fire Jerome Powell as Fed chair before his term ends in 2026.\\n\\nTrump hasn't publicly acknowledged the plans and his advisors said they're not endorsed by the campaign.\\n\\nMcKibbin and his fellow researchers did not examine Vice President Kamala Harris' policies in the same way because, according to the paper, she has not \\\"proposed any major departures from the Biden administration's policies and none with as significant international economic implications as Trump's.\\\"\\n\\nStill, McKibbin said he wishes there was more research on the subject.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nHe doesn't think the public is paying enough attention to the risks of Trump's Fed proposals or the overall murkiness of the candidates' economic policy. Neither Trump nor Harris has shared much about how to enact their proposals or their long-term economic impacts.\\n\\n\\\"If you're going to advocate a policy, there has to be evidence as to why you're advocating that policy,\\\" McKibbin said.\\n\\nThe policy haziness persists even as the economy is a top issue for many voters and potentially the deciding issue in the election.\"\n",

      "            \"text\": \"Sure, Wall Street. Go ahead. Ride the dragon.\\n\\nThere was a moment of grace on Tuesday for investors, market analysts, and finance's top brass when Beijing announced measures to try to reinvigorate China's croaking economy. Pan Gongsheng, a governor of the People's Bank of China, the country's central bank, announced that 800 billion yuan, or about $114 billion, would be injected into the stock market. Policymakers also said they were discussing raising a fund designed to stabilize stocks and announced rules allowing Chinese banks to keep less money in reserve, freeing up 1 trillion yuan to go out asloans. They also lowered the People's Bank of China's medium-term lending rate and key interest rates for banks and customers. Homebuyers can also now put less money down on their purchases \\u2014 an attempt to breathe life into China's moribund property market.\\n\\nThe immediate reaction from Wall Street was all-out jubilee. Since the pandemic, China's leader, Xi Jinping, has done little to stop the bleeding in the country's property market or to get China's ailing consumers to start spending money again. The Shanghai Composite lost nearly a quarter of its value. American companies in China are getting crushed. Foreign investors are pulling record amounts of money out of the country. This week's announcements sent Wall Street into a state of rapture, hoping that the Chinese Communist Party is now, as in years past, prepared to catch a falling knife. The Golden Dragon index \\u2014 a collection of Nasdaq-traded companies that do most of their business in China \\u2014 rallied 9% following the announcements. Financial-news talking heads heralded this as a clear sign from Beijing that policymakers were getting real about stopping China's descent into a deflationary funk. There would be more mergers and acquisitions! Lower rates could mean more private-equity activity! The famous Beijing \\\"bazooka\\\" could finally be on the way!\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nBut honey, they are delusional.\\n\\nXi's Beijing lacks the will and the power to turn China's economy around. At the heart of its problems is a lack of consumer demand and a property market going through a deep, slow-moving correction. Xi is ideologically opposed to jump-starting consumer spending with direct stimulus checks. No will. As for the power, Goldman Sachs estimated that returning China's apartment inventory to 2018 levels would require 7.7 trillion yuan. China's property market is so overbuilt and indebted that the trillions in stimulus needed to fix the problem \\u2014 and make the local governments that financed it whole again \\u2014 would make even a rapacious fundraiser like OpenAI CEO Sam Altman blush. The \\\"stimulus\\\" China's policymakers are offering is a drop in a well, and they know that. Wall Street should too. But I guess they haven't learned.\\n\\nThe measures the CCP announced are intended to make it easier for Chinese people to access capital and buy property, but access to debt is not the problem here. People in the country do not want to spend money because they are already sitting on large amounts of real-estate debt tied to declining properties. Seventy percent of Chinese household wealth is invested in property, which is a problem since analysts at Soci\\u00e9t\\u00e9 Gen\\u00e9ral\\u00e9 found that housing prices have fallen by as much as 30% in Tier 1 cities since their 2021 peak. Land purchases helped fund local governments so they could spend on schools, hospitals, and other social services \\u2014 now that financing mechanism is out of whack. Sinking prices in these sectors, or what economists call deflation, has spread to the wider economy. The latest consumer price inflation report showed that prices rose by just 0.3% in August compared to the year before, the lowest price growth in three years, prompting concerns that deflation will take hold, spreading to wages and killing jobs.\\n\\nIt's clear that Beijing's recent moves won't solve China's core economic problems.\\n\\nGiven that context, many Chinese people are not eager to spend. Consumers are trading down to cheaper products, and second-quarter retail sales grew by only 2.7% from the previous year. In a recent note to clients, the business surveyor China Beige Book said that business borrowing had barely budged since all-time lows in 2021, during the depths of the pandemic. Bottom line: It doesn't matter how cheap and easy it is to access loans if no one wants to take one out.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\\"These mostly supply-side measures would certainly be helpful if the problem in China was that production was struggling to keep up with growth in demand,\\\" Michael Pettis, a professor of finance at Peking University and a Carnegie Endowment fellow, said in a recent post on X. \\\"But with weak demand as the main constraint, these measures are more likely to boost the trade surplus than GDP growth.\\\"\\n\\nThe most direct way to spur demand in a deflating economy is to send checks to households. But again, Xi doesn't want to do that. The Chinese president is a follower of the Austrian economist Friedrich Hayek, who believed that direct stimulus distorts markets and leads to uncontrollable inflation. This flies in the face of what economists would recommend for China's situation, but those who criticize the way Xi does things tend to disappear.\\n\\nIt's clear that Beijing's recent moves won't solve China's core economic problems. And Wall Street's excitement misses another key problem: The measures aren't even all that big. Call it a bazooka or a blitz or whatever, but this stimulus is tiny compared with what we've seen from the CCP in the past. In 2009, the government dropped 7.6 trillion yuan to save the economy during the global financial crisis. In 2012, it dropped $157 billion on infrastructure projects. In 2015, it injected over $100 billion into ailing regional banks and devalued its currency to boost flagging exports. The CCP has shown that it's willing to take dramatic action to stabilize the economy. The price of that action, though, is massive debt built up all over the financial system, held especially by property companies, state-owned enterprises, and local governments. In the past, monetary easing calmed gyrations in the financial system, but growth has never been this slow, and debt has never been this high. The problem does not match the price tag here.\\n\\nThe Chinese Communist Party has a bubble on its hands, and it doesn't want to blow much more or see it burst in spectacular fashion. Plus, there's Xi, who seems fairly uninterested in restructuring the property market. He wants government investment to focus on developing frontier technology and boosting exports to grow the economy out of its structural debt problems. But those new streams of income have yet to materialize for China, and establishing them will take time and working through trade conflict, principally with the US and the European Union. Consider the easing measures we're seeing as something like a moment for markets to catch their breath \\u2014 a respite from what has been a constant stream of bad economic news. But a respite is all it is.\"\n",

The $65 billion decline was fueled by Tesla stock tanking more than 40% in that period.\\n\\nHowever, shares of the EV maker have surged by over 80% from their April low, driving a more than $100 billion increase in Musk's wealth to $270 billion at Wednesday's close. That includes an almost $50 billion rise since August 7, when Musk's fortune stood at an estimated $223 billion.\\n\\nThe epic comeback means Musk went from being the world's biggest wealth loser for the year in April, to the fourth-greatest gainer with a $41 billion increase. Only Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, and Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison have grown their net worth more.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nMusk also remains easily the richest person on the planet with a $270 billion fortune \\u2014 worth more than corporate titans like Salesforce ($262 billion), PepsiCo ($233 billion), or McDonald's ($216 billion). Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, worth $215 billion, and Zuckerberg, worth $202 billion, still trail him by a distance.\\n\\nYet it's worth noting that Musk has been much richer in the past. In November 2021, he was worth an astounding $340 billion. Tesla stock is down nearly 40% from there, leaving Musk about $70 billion poorer than at his peak.\\n\\nRelated stories\\n\\nTurning the corner\\n\\nMusk's wealth rebound this year reflects renewed optimism about not just Tesla but the wider stock market and US economy.\\n\\nThe Federal Reserve recently made its first cut to interest rates after hiking them from nearly zero to north of 5% in under 16 months, pushing stocks to record highs and easing inflation and recession fears.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThe Tesla chief warned last year that soaring prices, steeper rates, and a looming downturn were bad news for his company.\\n\\nConsumers had less disposable income to spend on a car, buying one had become more costly and difficult due to higher borrowing costs and stricter lending, and people may have been holding off buying a new car until the economy improved, he said.\\n\\nIn April, Musk announced sweeping layoffs, Tesla published disappointing first-quarter delivery numbers, and investors fretted about price cuts squeezing profit margins and Chinese rivals like BYD taking market share from Tesla. Those myriad concerns tanked the stock, but signs of easing economic pressures have underpinned a recovery in recent weeks.\\n\\nIt's worth noting that Musk's vast fortune also reflects his roughly 42% ownership of SpaceX, the rocket company valued at $210 billion in June, and his stakes in X, Neuralink, xAI, and The Boring Company.\"\n",

Though it was anything but, China's Ministry of Defense said the test launch was \\\"routine.\\\" It noted it was part of the country's training plan and said other countries were notified in advance.\\n\\nMaps shared online indicated the weapon, which was launched from Hainan, landed in the South Pacific after covering a distance of roughly 12,000 km. China's defense ministry said that the ICBM came down where expected.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nChina has not said which missile was tested, but the military has shared pictures online. China watchers and experts initially suggested it could've been a DF-41, one of PLARF's newer ICBMs. The three-stage, solid-fueled rocket has been tested out in the Gobi Desert and was publicly unveiled back in 2019. Other analysts have since said that the weapon was a DF-31 variant.\\n\\nChina's intercontinental ballistic missile test on Wednesday was its first in the Pacific in over 40 years. China People's Liberation Army News and Communication Center\\n\\nChina has conducted several ICBM tests in interior desert locations as its missile arsenal has grown, but Wednesday's test was different, providing China with something the other tests couldn't.\\n\\nRelated stories\\n\\nTianran Xu, an analyst for Open Nuclear Network, told Business Insider that \\\"if you launch towards the Pacific, that's the most realistic scenario because you can see how the rocket performs in completely realistic conditions.\\\"\\n\\nHe said that this kind of testing likely isn't indispensable, but \\\"it does have the advantage of being completely realistic.\\\"\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nChina has long tested missiles out in the desert, but as Decker Eveleth, a researcher at the Center for Naval Analyses, noted in a series of social media posts, \\\"the problem is that this forces you to use a lofted trajectory\\\" because the \\\"distance from the ICBM test site to the target ranges is around 2000-3000 kilometers.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That means, if the PLARF wanted to test a depressed trajectory, they're going to need to find another place to test their ICBMs,\\\" he said, referring to a lower, longer flight path.\\n\\nChinese military analysts arrived at similar conclusions. Song Zhongping, a retired PLARF officer and commentator, told the state-run China Daily that \\\"though China's intercontinental ballistic missiles have good reliability and strong power, we need a certain number of full-range tests to check their operational readiness.\\\"\\n\\nThe US notably conducts ICBM readiness tests regularly by launching Minuteman III ICBMs into the Pacific. These tests are fairly routine, unlike the Chinese test, which was the first such test since a DF-5 test in 1980.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nTianran said that China's interior missile tests likely have given China sufficient confidence in the capabilities of its weapons, but the test in the Pacific was a rare opportunity to mimic what a real launch would look like, including logistics, transportation, the skills of missile crews, and launching from atypical sites.\\n\\n\\\"Launching a missile is complicated and there are a variety of tasks that if you mess it up, that missile is going to miss the target,\\\" Eveleth said. \\\"By doing it out at Hainan and launching from a potentially unfamiliar launch location the missile crew may be unfamiliar with you can identify potential pitfalls in the process.\\\"\\n\\nChina's ICBM test comes less than a week before the 75th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. Xinhua/Lin Yiguang via Getty Images\\n\\nThe publicly announced ICBM launch comes as PLARF expands its nuclear arsenal and builds up its missile capabilities.\\n\\nLast fall, the Department of Defense reported that PLARF had effectively doubled its stockpiles of some missiles from 2021 to 2022, including medium-range ballistics capable of targeting US military assets in Japan and intermediate-range missiles able to reach Guam; its number of ICBMs went from 300 to 350, while its launchers for those missiles grew from 300 to 500.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThe \\\"dramatic expansion,\\\" coupled with other new developments, \\\"will significantly improve its nuclear-capable missile forces and will require increased nuclear-warhead production,\\\" the Pentagon said, estimating that China has more than 500 operational nuclear warheads \\u2014 making it the world's third-largest arsenal after Russia and the US.\\n\\nThe US recently deployed its Mid-Range Capability (MRC) Launcher to the Philippines. US Army photo by Captain Ryan DeBooy\\n\\nChina's ICBM test in the Pacific also comes as the country flexes its muscles, conducting joint naval drills with Russia that the Russian leader characterized as a challenge to the US-led world order, bullying neighboring nations, and testing boundaries.\\n\\nChina has faced repeated criticism for engaging in unsafe intercepts of American aircraft and those of its allies, airspace violations and breaches of territorial waters, and aggressive clashes at sea in contested waterways while also continuing to put increasing pressure on Taiwan.\\n\\nBeijing has likewise expressed frustration with the US military's presence in the region, including the indefinite deployment of a new missile system in the Philippines and a potential future one to Japan, among other things.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nA spokesperson for the Chinese Foreign Ministry recently accused the US, through its moves, of heightening an \\\"arms race\\\" and exacerbating \\\"regional tensions\\\" related to the deployment. China has also recently complained about transits by the US and its allies and partners through the Taiwan Strait.\\n\\nDespite the persistent tensions in the Indo-Pacific region, the Chinese military stated that its ICBM test was \\\"not directed against any country or target.\\\" It didn't say whether it plans to repeat this kind of test in the future.\"\n",

The telecoms giant Verizon Communications, meanwhile, is buying Frontier Communications for $20 billion, including debt.\\n\\nEven bigger megadeals could be on the horizon: Qualcomm is said to be stalking its chip rival Intel, which has a market value of nearly $104 billion.\\n\\nPreliminary data compiled by LSEG indicates that so far this year there have been 425 mergers worldwide valued at more than $1 billion, up by 24% from the 2023 period. And there have been 25 \\\"whales\\\" \\u2014 deals valued at greater than $10 billion \\u2014 so far this year, up by 39% from the previous period.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThe billion-dollar bangers are emerging even as the overall outlook is not that encouraging. The US election creates uncertainty about regulatory and economic policies for corporate chiefs. The wars in Ukraine and the Middle East pose additional risks.\\n\\nWhile the surge in megadeals has helped lift the dollar value of deals worldwide so far this year by 17%, to $2.3 trillion, the number of mergers announced is down by 21% from the previous year, according to LSEG.\\n\\nSo what has revived what Wall Street refers to as the \\\"animal spirits,\\\" at least when it comes to bigger targets?\\n\\nCertainly, lower interest rates help. Lower rates reduce the cost of borrowing.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nWall Street executives have also pointed to pent-up demand among companies as the pandemic and its aftermath, with higher inflation and supply-chain disruptions, delayed plans to grow through mergers.\\n\\nDavid Solomon, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, the leading global M&A advisor, referred to a \\\"backlog\\\" of transactions during the firm's second-quarter earnings call this summer.\\n\\nRelated stories\\n\\n\\\"From what we're seeing, we are in the early innings of the capital markets and M&A recovery,\\\" Solomon said. Merger activity, he noted, was still significantly below 10-year averages. \\\"I think we've got another 20% to go to get to 10-year averages,\\\" he said, according to a transcript by AlphaSense.\\n\\nOther Wall Street bank chiefs, like Ted Pick of Morgan Stanley and Peter Orszag of Lazard, have been bullish about the M&A pipeline.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nA recent survey of more than 1,300 CEOs of big companies worldwide by KPMG supports the idea that corporations are growing confident about doing deals. Some 49% of US CEOs surveyed said they were likely to undertake acquisitions over the next three years.\\n\\nShareholder activists are also spurring deals as companies look to simplify and refocus, Bloomberg reported. It said its data showed at least $250 billion worth of spinoffs and asset sales this year.\\n\\n\\\"Markets and activists are keeping companies honest,\\\" Hernan Cristerna, JPMorgan's global chairman of mergers and acquisitions, told Bloomberg. \\\"Executives want to preempt demands by exiting non-core assets that may fundamentally impair or distract from the performance of their core businesses.\\\"\"\n",

He is scheduled to be arraigned in a Manhattan federal court today .\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nIt marks the first time a sitting NYC mayor has been indicted.\\n\\nProsecutors accused Adams, a Democrat and retired police captain, of accepting more than $100,000 worth of luxury international travel from wealthy businesspeople and at least one Turkish government official starting after he became Brooklyn Borough President in 2014.\\n\\nThe goal, said Damian Williams, the US Attorney for the Southern District of New York, was to gain influence over Adams so foreign nationals could eventually \\\" cash in on their corrupt relationships .\\\"\\n\\nIn one case, according to the indictment, that meant a Turkish Airlines manager offering to charge Adams $50 for two business-class seats worth $15,000 .

The answer comes down to sentiment \\u2014 so much positive news for so long that it has become the new normal,\\\" Hayes said.\\n\\nHe added: \\\"The risk is that the lack of risk aversion would leave investors exposed to a degree of sustained macro deterioration yet to be experienced since the bull got underway.\\\"\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nHayes isn't calling for an imminent peak in the stock market, especially with falling interest rates historically acting as a tailwind for stock prices, but he's aware that it could happen.\\n\\n\\\"The last two secular bulls lasted 24 years (1942 - 1966) and 18 years (1982 - 2000). But with the secular bull mature, we're watching out for signs that it may be at risk,\\\" Hayes said.\\n\\nThe first warning sign of a near-term peak in the stock market is worsening breadth among the underlying issues of the US stock market.\\n\\nIn other words, if only a handful of companies drive the stock market higher, that would be a bad sign, as it was at the secular top in 2000.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nInvestors don't have to worry about that signal flashing just yet, with recent data showing a surge in market breadth.\\n\\nExtreme valuations would be another warning sign to watch for, according to Hayes, who added that high valuations price in a perfect macro environment, and if something goes wrong, those valuations can fall apart rather quickly.\\n\\n\\\"Expensive valuations appear justified when earnings growth is coming through, but that also leaves the market vulnerable when earnings turn lower,\\\" Hayes said.\\n\\nLong-term peaks in the stock market also typically occur when earnings growth and economic growth hit extreme levels, as the other side of that boom is typically a swift deceleration in growth.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThe secular stock market peaks of 1929, 1966, and 2000 all coincided with a peak in S&P 500 earnings growth, \\\"after which prices dropped on the growing realization that the valuations were not justified,\\\" Hayes said.\\n\\nWhile valuations and earnings growth are currently at high levels, they could have more room to grow, according to the note.\\n\\n\\\"The current level of earnings growth has yet to reach its levels at the peaks in 1929 and 2000 but has already closed in on its levels of 1966,\\\" Hayes said.\\n\\nHe added: \\\"For a downturn in earnings growth, we would expect to see a downturn in economic growth.\\\"\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nFinally, Hayes said investors should keep an eye on bond yields and commodities, as they will reflect a potential rebound in inflation. And a rebound in inflation, coupled with rising interest rates, would be an unwelcome warning sign for the current bull rally in stocks.\\n\\n\\\"If that would start to change with a severe cyclical bear, the secular bear warnings would strengthen, and we would be likely to see reversals from extremes in valuations, earnings growth, and economic performance,\\\" Hayes concluded.\"\n",

It's been going on for about as long as I can remember.\\n\\nMy closet brimmed over with bags of clothes I planned to try on once I lost those last five pounds. Old paint tubes from a freshman college class took up precious real estate on my desk, reminding me to eke out one more painting one day. I even kept dried roses from a bouquet I made as a florist. You'd think I was preserving precious relics by hanging onto these dried blooms that were more dust than flower. I became excellent at Tretis-ing miscellany in every nook and cranny of my home.\\n\\nWhen the ambitious fervor to declutter arose, I struggled to determine what sparked joy and what to part with. I knew I'd feel calmer and freer if I cleared out the clutter, yet when facing all my stuff, I felt paralyzed.\\n\\nI was constantly waffling when trying to decide what to get rid of. What if I actually needed the torn tote bag that I might mend someday? And I might regret giving up that T-shirt from Grandpa, even though it doesn't fit. Finally, how wasteful would I be to throw away this face moisturizer before it's completely gone? The inner turmoil was a battle between absurdity and prudence.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThen, on a blustery evening in March, a rogue spark set my childhood home ablaze.\\n\\nSuddenly, all of that stuff was gone\\n\\nFlames rained down from an HVAC vent. After calling 911 and alerting my dad outside, I ran back in to retrieve our pet rabbits. The fire had already eaten up half the roof. I ran out of the house without shoes. The sudden, violent alchemy of the fire had reduced our home \\u2014 and its 40 years of memories \\u2014 to charred rubble. By the time the last fire truck rolled out of our driveway, all that stuff I'd accumulated was gone.\\n\\nRelated stories\\n\\nThe day after the fire, I feebly began replacing some of what we'd lost. With the generous help of a gift card from my boss and coworkers, I could afford some basics. Disheveled, smelling of smoke, and tears streaking my face, I shuffled down the Target aisles. Waves of grief and anguish hit me as I bought pet supplies, underwear, and shoes. The sudden scarcity brought my life's inventory into heightened focus.\\n\\nThat scarcity was also met with overwhelming support. Friends, neighbors, and even strangers brought us home-cooked meals, clothes, furniture, and bedding. After losing years' worth of writing, dear friends and family gave me new journals. Family members mailed me books, paint brushes, and blank pages to fill up. Even now, it's hard to articulate the feeling of whiplash: the sadness of loss and displacement extinguished by immense generosity and gratitude for the care of our community.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nFrom the rubble, I learned a few lessons\\n\\nAs fast as our home burned down, the recovery is glacial in its pace. Every day my mom and I suddenly remember something we lost. I collect receipts for what I've replaced, and painstakingly assess how not to perpetuate my cycle of accumulating without decluttering. The fire has confronted me to break this cycle.\\n\\nWe cling to our earthly possessions for many reasons: a scarcity mindset, an emotional attachment, or even the simple comfort of having familiar things that make us happy. With each reason, countless articles and tidying experts offer tips and services for clearing away the minutia. No one needs (or deserves) a house fire to clean out their closet. It's painful, strange, and sad. But grief often comes with lessons.\\n\\nThe fire's forced reset has me reflecting on what it takes to let go. Instead of seeking satisfaction in a clean closet or curating a room in a minimalist style, I'm making room to understand my reasons to cling to the stuff of life. Facing loss and grief with acceptance makes room to cultivate trust in oneself. It makes room for resilience and resourcefulness.\\n\\nIf I could offer advice to someone struggling to declutter, it might be this: Instead of thinking about how you might regret parting with that clothing, appliance, or sentimental object, consider what you might gain from letting go. What will you make room for next?\"\n",

He estimated an increase in oil prices of $10 a barrel could raise inflation in advanced economies by about 0.4 to 0.6 percentage points, and a 10% rise in shipping costs could lift it by about 0.3 percentage points.\\n\\nUS crude has already climbed by 10% in just over a week to over $74 a barrel on Friday, its highest level since August, while Brent crude is up almost 9% to above $78.\\n\\nRelated stories\\n\\nKaya said resurgent inflation could lead central banks to delay cuts to interest rates, dampening growth at a time when recession fears are rife in many countries.\\n\\nIn Israel, the war and its lack of an obvious endpoint have knocked confidence and curbed investing and growth, making it harder for authorities to temper rising inflation without crushing the economy, said Assaf Razin, a professor emeritus at the Eitan Berglas School of Economics at Tel Aviv University.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nHe told BI the government must urgently improve its policies and close social and economic gaps, or \\\"Israel's negative economic spiral could deepen, putting its status as a stable nation at risk.\\\"\\n\\nWeathering the storm\\n\\nThe conflict is less of a worry for the US, according to Oliver Allen, a senior economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. Rising oil prices could drive inflation but they've dropped since the spring, and the US is a net energy exporter, so the effect on incomes and economic activity would \\\"probably be trivial,\\\" he told BI.\\n\\nConfidence is unlikely to take a meaningful knock unless there's material escalation, Allen added.\\n\\nHowever, Hurricane Helene could trigger a \\\"fairly sharp rise\\\" in next week's initial jobless claims data, and reduce nonfarm payroll employment by about 20,000 in October's report, Allen said. But he emphasized that hurricanes have historically had limited and short-lived impacts on growth and inflation.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\\"The most likely outcome looks like a small but passing impact on some of the lower-level activity data and a slight, but also temporary, lift to inflation from some of these supply-side shocks,\\\" he said.\\n\\nAn Oxford Economics report said that Hurricane Helene could affect several parts of the US economy \\u2014 including consumer spending, the job market, housing, business profits, and industrial production \\u2014 but it would likely have only a minimal impact on fourth-quarter GDP.\\n\\nOxford Economics researchers said state and local economies might suffer but there would probably be limited fallout at the national level. Output is poised to recover during the rest of this quarter, boosted by cleanup and rebuilding after the storm, they said.\\n\\nOne piece of good news arrived on Thursday night as tens of thousands of striking port workers agreed to suspend strike action and return to work while contract negotiations continue.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nTrouble in China\\n\\nChina is facing a cocktail of economic challenges. Its GDP grew by a disappointing 4.7% year-on-year in the second quarter, down from an annual average of nearly 8% for the decade before the pandemic.\\n\\nHowever, \\\"that's not all bad given high inflation last year,\\\" Duncan Wrigley, the chief China economist at macroeconomic researchers Pantheon, told BI, adding inflation would have been higher had the economy grown faster.\\n\\nHe predicted that China's recently unveiled economic stimulus package would buttress short-term growth but would not address its root problems such as high youth unemployment and a beleaguered property market. Wrigley suggested those and other issues could rear their heads again next year, spurring Beijing to offer further support.\"\n",

He is also a vice president at consultancy Patomak Global Partners.\\n\\nChina keeps circling back to the dollar\\n\\nTo be sure, China has been trying to reduce its reliance on the dollar. Notably, it set up the yuan-based Cross-Border Interbank Payment System, CIPS, to process transactions. However, many CIPS participants are highly connected to the dollar financial system and potentially subject to the reach of US sanctions.\\n\\nMeanwhile, about half of China's foreign reserves are held in the dollar. The country's dollar assets in 2023 were over 15 times the value of Russia's in 2019, wrote Greene. Russia's central bank reduced dollar-denominated foreign reserve assets significantly from 2020 in the leadup to its invasion of Ukraine, which means China's dollar reserves could be far higher than Russia's by this point.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\\"China could also, in theory, modestly diversify some reserves away from the dollar into government debt securities denominated in currencies of relatively small and open economies,\\\" wrote Greene.\\n\\nHowever, non-major currency assets \\u2014 outside the realm of dollar, euro, and yen \\u2014 \\\"may not present meaningfully less geopolitical risk than the dollar.\\\"\\n\\nRelated stories\\n\\nOther than foreign exchange reserves, China's largest state-owned financial institutes, including its four major state-owned commercial banks, are deeply interconnected to the US financial system.\\n\\n\\\"These institutions often rely on dollar funding to finance overseas activities, and in recent years at times maintained dollar-denominated liabilities worth significantly more than dollar-denominated assets,\\\" Greene wrote, citing a research paper published by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston in 2022.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nChina's ties to the dollar manifest in other ways.\\n\\nMost of China's Belt and Road Initiative loans have been denominated in the dollar.

Including the single-day sell-off, Spirit's stock has fallen by roughly 90% in 2024.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nSpirit's CEO, Ted Christie, said on an earnings call in August that Spirit was in talks with advisors and bondholders about its debt.\\n\\nWhile Spirit faces a turbulent future, a Chapter 11 filing isn't necessarily a death sentence for the airline. Rather, Chapter 11 allows businesses to reorganize their debts while continuing their operations. Other airlines have used the process to stay afloat.\\n\\nMost recently, Scandinavian Airlines filed for Chapter 11 in the US in 2022 following a pilot strike. The airline underwent a $3 billion restructuring plan to revise its fleet and raise money while continuing to operate. The company emerged from bankruptcy in August.\\n\\nIn 2005, Delta Air Lines filed for bankruptcy after shedding 6,000 jobs and slashing $1 billion in labor costs. By optimizing its Atlanta hub and increasing its international routes, the company recovered from its financial troubles and remains one of the largest airlines in the US.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nA bankruptcy filing could serve as a similar lifeline for Spirit's management of debt and finances.\\n\\nSpirit bumped up its ticket prices this summer, shifting away from its ultra-low-cost model to boost revenue after suffering a $143 million loss in the first quarter of this year and a $193 million loss in the second quarter.\\n\\nRelated stories\\n\\nSpirit has faced annual losses since before the COVID-19 pandemic, despite the travel industry's recovery, and it continues to struggle against larger airlines that offer competitive fares.\\n\\nThe airline has cut routes, furloughed pilots, and shrunk its operational capacity by nearly 20%.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nWhen contacted by Business Insider, Spirit Airlines referred to Christie's comments in the August earnings call but didn't comment further.\\n\\nCorrection: October 4, 2024 \\u2014 An earlier version of this story misstated the year Delta filed for bankruptcy protection.

The couple weren't worried, though; they knew a storm was coming, but hadn't been told to evacuate because their home was on high ground in the Blue Ridge Mountains.\\n\\nStill, they had prepared for flooding and had enough food, supplies, and a generator to survive for one or two weeks \\\"if it got really bad,\\\" Marsh, a 34-year-old metalworker, told Business Insider.\\n\\nBut they didn't know that several days of heavy rain from Hurricane Helene had weakened the soil on the mountain, triggering a landslide that was headed straight down toward their home.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nMarsh and Thomas' house before it was destroyed by Hurricane Helene. Andrew Marsh\\n\\nMarsh and Thomas were thrown down the mountain by a wave of sliding earth, rocks, and trees that onlookers estimated was 40 to 60 feet high, destroying their home and livelihoods in a matter of seconds.\\n\\nThe debris crushed Thomas, dislocating her legs and leaving her unable to walk. Marsh had \\\"at least 50\\\" flesh wounds and couldn't use his right hand because it was sliced open down to the muscle, he said.\\n\\nHelene is estimated to have caused up to $34 billion worth of damage\\n\\nSince Helene made landfall, at least 215 people have been confirmed dead, making it the second deadliest hurricane in the US in recent years, after Katrina in 2005.\\n\\nOn Monday, Moodys estimated the hurricane caused between $20 billion and $34 billion worth of damage, with between $15 billion to $26 billion affecting properties alone.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAs the Federal Emergency Management Agency estimates that only 4% of homeowners in the US have flood insurance, and those who do might not be covered for flooding or landslides, this looks to be an expensive disaster for many.\\n\\nMarsh and Thomas, 40, a yoga teacher and masseuse, will be dealing with the aftermath long after Thomas is discharged from hospital. The couple told Business Insider they will have to rebuild their lives and careers from scratch, all while paying off medical bills, trying to claim home insurance, and dealing with the psychological fallout.\\n\\nThomas and Marsh hold hands in hospital. Andrew Marsh\\n\\nStories like Marsh and Thomas' are only going to become more common as the climate crisis brings more rain, and with it landslides to vulnerable areas, researchers concluded in a 2016 paper published in Earth-Science Reviews.\\n\\nNatural disasters have already cost the US in a big way: between 1980 and 2021, the country spent $2 trillion on both immediate and longer-term restoration such as repairing infrastructure, a 2023 article published in The Journal of Climate Change and Health found.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n'Mud and water was being pressed into my nose, ears, and mouth'\\n\\nJust before 10 a.m., the couple heard a \\\"deep rumbling\\\" and \\\"loud cracking thunder-like noises\\\" a few hundred yards from their home, Thomas said, before the ground dropped out from beneath their feet.\\n\\nRelated stories\\n\\n\\\"It happened so fast that there was no chance of reacting. The best way I've been able to describe it is as if somebody just threw the house into a blender and hit the puree button,\\\" Marsh said.\\n\\nThomas added: \\\"I just fell down and down. I remember my vision going from light to brown to black, and mud and water was being pressed into my nose, ears, and mouth.\\n\\n\\\"I remember a very specific moment where I kind of surrendered and recognized 'I am dying right now.' So I decided to just soften to the experience and moved into more of a place of acceptance and acknowledging all of my blessings.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\\"I let go of my phone, and it felt really good to let go of the struggle.\\\"\\n\\nIt was then that she was \\\"miraculously spit out\\\" of the sliding earth and found herself about an eighth of a mile from where their home had been, straddling a tree trunk and covered head to toe in mud.\\n\\nWhere Marsh and Thomas' home used to stand in Marion, NC. Andrew Marsh\\n\\nIt took hours for rescue workers to find the couple\\n\\nMarsh managed to pull himself from the debris with some effort. He then helped Thomas, who had lost the use of her legs, down from the tree trunk, before digging their neighbor, John Norwood, out of neck-deep rubble. They didn't know where Norwood's fianc\\u00e9, Julie le Roux, was, and he \\\"wandered off\\\" to try to find her, Marsh said. She was still missing as of October 3.\\n\\nMarsh found an empty Airbnb property about 250 yards away and helped Thomas limp into it. There, they were able to do some basic first aid about three hours after the landslide.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nNorwood showed up after two hours, \\\"covered head to toe in wounds,\\\" he said.\\n\\nThen, at about 4 p.m., six hours after the landslide, they spotted a rescue worker across a 50-foot-wide flow of runoff. By midnight, the three were evacuated from the area by North Carolina State Fire Marshals and were treated for their injuries at nearby hospitals by what Thomas described as an \\\"amazing\\\" EMT care team.\\n\\nCovering medical costs 'somehow'\\n\\n\\\"We're both still in a lot of pain. It's near constant, but there's definitely signs that we're making a recovery and that we are going to be OK,\\\" Marsh said.\\n\\nThomas and Marsh must now try to rebuild their lives. Andrew Marsh\\n\\nAs a veteran, Marsh has access to a medical benefits package, but Thomas is without active health insurance. They will have to cover her medical costs \\\"somehow,\\\" Marsh said. But since he lost his workshop, van, and equipment in the disaster, and Thomas' job depends on the \\\"strength and mobility\\\" of her body, it's unclear how.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThe couple had home insurance, but their insurer has refused to cover the loss of their home because it was destroyed by a landslide, not a flood. But \\\"even with the homeowners insurance policy, if it was to completely pay out, it wouldn't come close to being able to replace our lives,\\\" Marsh said.\\n\\nFor now, Thomas is trying to remain in the present and not worry too much about the future, although it hasn't fully hit her that they \\\"don't have a home to go back to,\\\" she said.\\n\\nMarsh's brother set up a GoFundMe for the couple, to cover their medical expenses, temporary housing, and living costs as they get situated. Marsh said that although he struggles with the idea of accepting help, he knows they need as much as they can get right now.\\n\\n\\\"When this whole situation has passed, I'm going to dedicate some part of my life to returning the favor to the world,\\\" he said.\"\n",

The forecast calls for increased productivity to fuel economic growth while inflation remains subdued.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nIf the S&P 500 does trade at the 8,000 level with EPS of $400, it would imply a price-to-earnings ratio of 20x, which is below current levels but slightly above the index's long-term average.\\n\\nFinally, interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve should serve as another tailwind for stock prices in the years ahead, though Yardeni has cautioned that they could just add fuel to the fire, leading to a 1990's style melt-up, which would be followed by a painful unwind.\\n\\n\\\"I raised the odds of an outright melt-up, like something we had in the 1990s,\\\" Yardeni said last week. \\\"I think that by cutting rates by 50 basis points and by indicating they want to do more, based on some of the recent comments, they risk overheating a warm economy.

      "            \"text\": \"DETROIT (AP) \\u2014 Some 45,000 dockworkers at East and Gulf coast ports are returning to work after their union reached a deal to suspend a strike that could have caused shortages and higher prices if it had dragged on.\\n\\nThe International Longshoremen\\u2019s Association is suspending its three-day strike until Jan. 15 to provide time to negotiate a new contract. The union and the U.S. Maritime Alliance, which represents ports and shipping companies, said in a joint statement that they have reached a tentative agreement on wages.\\n\\nA person briefed on the agreement said the ports sweetened their wage offer from about 50% over six years to 62%. The person didn\\u2019t want to be identified because the agreement is tentative. Any wage increase would have to be approved by union members as part of the ratification of a final contract.\\n\\nTalks now turn to the automation of ports, which the unions says will lead to fewer jobs, and other sticking points.\\n\\nIndustry analysts have said that for every day of a port strike it takes four to six days to recover. But they said a short strike of a few days probably wouldn\\u2019t gum up the supply chain too badly.\\n\\nThe settlement pushes the strike and any potential shortages past the November presidential election, eliminating a potential liability for Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee. It\\u2019s also a big plus for the Biden-Harris administration, which has billed itself as the most union-friendly in American history. Shortages could have driven up prices and reignited inflation.\\n\\nThe union went on strike early Tuesday after its contract expired in a dispute over pay and the automation of tasks at 36 ports stretching from Maine to Texas. The strike came at the peak of the holiday season at the ports, which handle about half the cargo from ships coming into and out of the United States.\\n\\nMost retailers had stocked up or shipped items early in anticipation of the strike.\\n\\n\\u201cWith the grace of God, and the goodwill of neighbors, it\\u2019s gonna hold,\\u201d President Joe Biden told reporters Thursday night after the agreement.\\n\\nIn a statement later, Biden applauded both sides \\u201cfor acting patriotically to reopen our ports and ensure the availability of critical supplies for Hurricane Helene recovery and rebuilding.\\u201d\\n\\nBiden said that collective bargaining is \\u201ccritical to building a stronger economy from the middle out and the bottom up.\\u201d\\n\\nThe union\\u2019s membership won\\u2019t need to vote on the temporary suspension of the strike. Until Jan. 15, the workers will be covered under the old contract, which expired on Sept. 30.\\n\\nThe union had been demanding a 77% raise over six years, plus a complete ban on the use of automation at the ports, which members see as a threat to their jobs. Both sides also have been apart on the issues of pension contributions and the distribution of royalties paid on containers that are moved by workers.\\n\\nThomas Kohler, who teaches labor and employment law at Boston College, said the agreement to halt the strike means that the two sides are close to a final deal.\\n\\n\\u201cI\\u2019m sure that if they weren\\u2019t going anywhere they wouldn\\u2019t have suspended (the strike),\\u201d he said. \\u201cThey\\u2019ve got wages. They\\u2019ll work out the language on automation, and I\\u2019m sure that what this really means is it gives the parties time to sit down and get exactly the language they can both live with.\\u201d\\n\\nKohler said the surprise end to the strike may catch railroads with cars, engines and crews out of position. But railroads are likely to work quickly to fix that.\\n\\nJust before the strike had begun, the Maritime Alliance said both sides had moved off their original wage offers, a tentative sign of progress.\\n\\nThursday\\u2019s deal came after Biden administration officials met with foreign-owned shipping companies before dawn on Zoom, according to a person briefed on the day\\u2019s events who asked not to be identified because the talks were private. The White House wanted to increase pressure to settle, emphasizing the responsibility to reopen the ports to help with recovery from Hurricane Helene, the person said.\\n\\nActing Labor Secretary Julie Su told them she could get the union to the bargaining table to extend the contract if the carriers made a higher wage offer. Chief of Staff Jeff Zients told the carriers they had to make an offer by the end of the day so a manmade strike wouldn\\u2019t worsen a natural disaster, the person said.\\n\\nBy midday the Maritime Alliance members agreed to a large increase, bringing about the agreement, according to the person.\"\n",

The report also revised up the hiring numbers for the prior two months and indicated a drop in the unemployment rate.\\n\\nYardeni is the latest to chime in on Fed policy after the data on job growth topped all estimates. Earlier Friday, former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers said the central bank\\u2019s decision to cut interest rates last month was \\u201ca mistake.\\u201d\\n\\nThe release also prompted economists at Bank of America Corp. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. to trim their forecast for the Fed\\u2019s November interest-rate cut to a quarter-point from a half-point, echoing moves in swap contracts tied to the outcome of future Fed meetings.\\n\\nStill, calling the Fed to pause completely for the rest of 2024 is out of consensus, to say the least. Many investors consider the Fed\\u2019s latest rate cut as a step toward normalizing its policy amid easing inflation after a round of aggressive tightening took the benchmark borrowing cost to a two-decade high.\\n\\nThat said, it\\u2019s an idea Ian Lyngen is now mulling. While the head of US rates strategy at BMO Capital Markets is sticking to his forecast for a quarter-point reduction in November, he reckons a slew of data on employment and inflation will determine the Fed\\u2019s policy trajectory before its Nov. 7 meeting. Should October\\u2019s payrolls report come in comparably strong and inflation prove sticky, US central bankers will likely refrain from rate cuts for now, per Lyngen.\\n\\n\\u201cIf anything, the employment update suggests that the Fed might be revisiting the prudence of cutting in November at all \\u2013 although a pause is not our base case,\\u201d he wrote in a note to clients. \\u201cIn our endeavor to be intellectually honest, it is worth briefly pondering what it would take for the Fed to pause next month.\\u201d\\n\\nFor critics of the Fed\\u2019s policy shift, the market has arguably priced in too many rate reductions already. The risk, according to Yardeni, is that additional easing feeds into investor euphoria that will set stage for a painful market event.\\n\\n\\u201cAny further rate cuts would increase the odds of our 1990s-style meltup scenario for the stock market,\\u201d he said. In that episode, the S&P 500 lost more than a third of its value from peak to trough.\"\n",

The International Longshoremen's Association said on Sunday that it was prepared to strike on October 1. The nation's largest union of maritime workers is demanding higher wages, among other conditions.\\n\\nJon Davis, the chief meteorologist at Everstream Analytics, which focuses on supply-chain risk, told Business Insider that the storm and the strike would have massive \\\"compounding effects.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It's not one plus one equals two,\\\" he said. \\\"One plus one equals a lot more than that.\\\"\\n\\nJPMorgan analysts have estimated that the costs of shutdowns related to the strike could reach $5 billion a day. It would be the first to span a US coast since 1977 and would involve ports that account for about half of the country's ocean shipping. Some 45,000 workers could lay down their metaphorical tools.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nOn top of the catastrophic damage to infrastructure in hard-hit states like Florida, Georgia, and North Carolina, a strike would undoubtedly slow the movement of critical goods, including food and vehicles.\\n\\nAn inflation driver\\n\\nAny slowdown in the US's critical supply chains could fan inflation at a time when the Federal Reserve has begun to lower its benchmark interest rate to avoid tipping the economy into a recession. Price increases have cooled year over year, though prices remain high for certain goods, like eggs, which are more expensive because of bird flu.\\n\\nRelated stories\\n\\nAmir Mousavian, a professor of supply-chain management at the University of New England's College of Business, said that the impact of a strike would depend on how long it lasts but that the consequences would be substantial.\\n\\nHe told BI that perishable goods would be affected almost immediately and that grocery-store shortages could trigger panic buying akin to what unfolded during the pandemic.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nShipping costs could also jump as businesses seek alternate means of getting goods to customers, such as importing and exporting goods on the West Coast.\\n\\n\\\"The timing of the strike is especially concerning, as the US economy has seen progress in lowering inflation,\\\" Mousavian said. \\\"A prolonged strike could reverse these gains, forcing the Federal Reserve to reconsider its economic strategy and possibly reintroduce more restrictive measures.\\\"\\n\\nA supply chain that's not resilient\\n\\nMousavian said the situation was a reminder of what the pandemic revealed: The US supply chain is \\\"efficient but not resilient,\\\" and it needs to be stronger and more adaptable to withstand future crises.\\n\\nJason Greer, the president of Greer Consulting and a former agent with the National Labor Relations Board, told BI that the industrial action is likely to happen and that the combination with the hurricane's effects would \\\"be devastating overall.\\\"\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nHe said he expects the union will walk out because members feel that their concerns haven't been taken seriously for too long.\\n\\n\\\"The longshoremen have said: 'We continue to be pushed aside. We continue to be pushed aside. We're not going to be pushed aside any longer.' So I think the overall economic damage is huge,\\\" Greer said, highlighting effects like higher grocery prices.\\n\\nMeantime, Angela Blanchard, Houston's chief recovery and resilience officer, argued on X that the response to and recovery from the hurricane would be \\\"significantly impeded\\\" by a strike. She predicted that disruption at the ports would crimp the availability of materials and fuel \\u2014 and affect prices.\\n\\n\\\"This will be a long and complicated recovery season,\\\" Blanchard wrote.\"\n",

By the time we left, we avoided driving to or through downtown at all costs due to the traffic congestion.\\n\\nEven worse, the central expressway, I-35, was built in 1962 when the city had a population just north of 200,000. Now, with just shy of a million residents, the infrastructure doesn't support the number of people who use it daily.\\n\\nAlthough construction on I-35 is set to start this year, the projected completion date of the expansion is years away \\u2014 and traffic will likely get worse before it gets better.\\n\\nThe rising number of visitors hasn't helped either \\u2014 millions of tourists visit Texas' capital each year, which can make Austin feel pretty crowded.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nWe felt big businesses slowly took away from what made Austin special\\n\\n\\\"Keep Austin Weird\\\" is an ode to the eclectic mix of small businesses found throughout the city. Dmitri Kotchetov/Shutterstock\\n\\nThe Texas capital is known for its motto, \\\"Keep Austin Weird,\\\" an ode to the eclectic mix of small businesses found throughout the city.\\n\\nRelated stories\\n\\nSlowly but surely, we've watched these small businesses disappear, taking the charmingly odd vibe of Austin and morphing it into the overpriced, polished feel of any other big city.\\n\\nA perfect example is South Congress, or SoCo, a popular draw for locals and tourists. The street was once lined with offbeat stores with unique Austin offerings and welcoming shop owners.\\n\\nVisitors could park for free and stroll the street, enjoying places like the iconic costume shop, a gallery featuring handmade bedazzled skulls, and an emporium of uncommon items.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nHowever, it's gotten harder for small-business owners to survive. Some SoCo business owners told local ABC TV station KVUE that their rent increased by as much as 500% this year.\\n\\nEven just walking through the neighborhood, it's easy to see how much the area has changed. Chains like Nike, Herm\\u00e8s, and Warby Parker now line the streets, and parking is no longer free.\\n\\nWe've found a better sense of community in the suburbs\\n\\nIn the past decade, the road one street away from our Austin home underwent extreme growth business-wise, and we started to hear more and more traffic from our house.\\n\\nThe open stretch of land that once led us to hill country was replaced with an ever-growing strip of bars. Our once peaceful neighborhood became a popular spot for bar crawls, and we regularly heard a lot of loud, late-night partiers.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nWe had a fantastic decade enjoying the city but knew it was time for us to start fresh in the suburbs. Fortunately, our tough choice of moving 15 minutes south of Austin paid off, and we've already begun building a strong community.\\n\\nIn our new neighborhood, we go on walks where we spot wildlife like deer and foxes. Our neighbors are welcoming and inclusive \\u2014 they look out for each other. It feels like a stark contrast to the seemingly constant rotation of renters and Airbnbs surrounding us in Austin.\\n\\nTimes change, and so do cities, but I wish Austin had preserved what made it so unique.\"\n",

Two said they expected it be broadcast globally and ad-free.\\n\\nThese people were granted anonymity to speak freely about private deal talks. Their identities are known to BI.\\n\\nDetails of the special have been trickling out over the past few days in outlets like Variety and CNN, although Amazon has not confirmed the deal and it's possible it won't come to fruition.\\n\\nNews of the potential deal has sparked questions in the industry about whether the tech giant plans to expand as deeply into news as it has with filmed entertainment and sports.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThe people close to the deal talks rebuffed the idea that Amazon would build its own news operation, however. They said Amazon sees the special as another way to amass big audiences, as it has done with the NFL's \\\"Thursday Night Football\\\" and other sports. The special has the potential to reach more than 200 million viewers, which is Prime Video's monthly reach, according to Amazon's most recent public disclosure.\\n\\nIf it goes well, Amazon could repeat the approach with other big news events, one of the people close to the deal talks said. Those events could include the presidential inauguration or State of the Union address, this person predicted.\\n\\nRelated stories\\n\\n\\\"It's a toe in the water for them in that they're trying to get beyond sports to other, seasonal special types of events,\\\" this person said. \\\"There's news-adjacent programming they could do.\\\"\\n\\nTwo of the people close to the deal talks said the election-night special was expected to be ad-free. No final decisions have been made, though. But Amazon and other tech-rooted streamers have seen how live programming, like comedy specials and awards shows, creates appointment viewing that can be highly attractive to advertisers. Advertisers, and especially marketers with time-sensitive product launches, have shown a willingness to pay high prices to reach large live audiences. Amazon this year turned on ads in Prime Video, gunning for the nearly $70 billion in annual TV ad spending.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nFor Amazon, specifically, filmed entertainment and sports programming \\u2014 part of Prime Video \\u2014 also serves to keep people subscribing to its lucrative Prime service and get people to shop more on the platform. Prime Video's 2023 Black Friday NFL game, for example, showed QR codes during breaks to promote deals on the site.\\n\\n\\\"It fits in with their interest in disruptions and amassing big audiences,\\\" the second person close to the deal talks said. \\\"They want to be in the big-event business.\\\"\\n\\nNews has been slow to shift to streaming\\n\\nBig champions of the election-night special within Amazon include Mike Hopkins, senior vice president of Prime Video and Amazon MGM Studios, and his powerful No. 2, Albert Cheng, vice president of Prime Video US. Hopkins has played a role in Prime Video's aggressive expansion into sports, which has created tension with some on the entertainment side who see the sports investment coming at the expense of film and TV budgets.\\n\\nIf the deal goes through, the special would be produced by Jonathan Wald, a veteran TV news producer who executive-produced Williams' \\\"11th Hour\\\" on MSNBC and has lately focused on new news formats. He helped Don Lemon launch shows on social media, for example. Williams' reps at talent agency CAA have also been involved.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nWhile entertainment and sports have shifted to streaming, news has been slower to follow. Legacy broadcasters like NBC News and ABC News have invested in live-streamed content; CNN has planned a streaming subscription service, but it's had starts and stops.\\n\\nTech companies with streaming services have generally steered clear of news \\u2014 not surprisingly, given the high cost of operating a newsroom and how polarizing news can be.\\n\\nNetflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos, in a recent interview, rejected the idea of the streamer covering breaking news. Apple TV+ drifted into news-adjacent programming in 2020 with Jon Stewart, who hosted a weekly comedy news show. But Stewart walked away after two seasons, saying Apple increasingly wanted more oversight of the show's editorial direction.\\n\\nAmazon, for its part, wants to bring a down-the-middle presentation of election results hosted by Williams with a lineup of exclusive contributors. To lend a nonpartisan feel, the plan is that the presenters won't call the race and will point viewers to third-party content (which could include sites like CNN and NBC News that are available through Amazon Channels). The event would be broadcast from LA, allowing it to run late into the night.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAnd while some elements would be familiar to a news audience, Amazon is expected to put its own twist on the potential presentation, similar to how it souped up the production of \\\"Thursday Night Football\\\" with on-screen overlays that predict what might happen next.\"\n",

That's because the job market is slowing, and inflation could remain sticker than markets are expecting \\u2014 two headwinds that could spark as much as a 10% decline in the S&P 500, he predicted in a recent interview with CNBC.\\n\\n\\\"When you add it all together, it's a slowing economy, particularly on the jobs side \\u2014 there are a lot of options out there, and the market's expensive. So, we would certainly urge caution going into the late third and fourth quarter,\\\" Bannister said.\\n\\nThe slowing job market has already caught the attention of investors, who are watching for signs of continued economic weakness. 18% of US consumers reported said jobs were hard to get in September, up from just 17% of consumers recorded the prior month, according to the Conference Board's latest Consumer Confidence Survey.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nUS companies, meanwhile, announced more than 75,000 job cuts in August, a 193% increase from the prior month, according to a report from Challenger, Gray & Christmas.\\n\\nInflationary pressures could also linger around the economy, which could complicate the market's vision for steep rate cuts, Bannister suggested. Investors are largely expecting interest rates to fall to 3% or lower by mid-next year, according to the CME FedWatch tool. But he says that's unlikely to happen without the economy seeing a slowdown, which is also bearish for stocks.\\n\\n\\\"It's very hard to justify getting below 3% without a slowdown,\\\" Bannister said of interest rates. \\\"If we don't have a slowdown, if we continue to utilize these limited resources that we have, what you'd end up with is a no landing scenario, where rates and yields should not be dramatically lower.\\\"\\n\\nInvestors also look a little too optimistic, given that stocks are hovering close to their all-time highs, Bannister said. Nearly half of all investors said they felt bullish on stocks for the next six months, according to the AAII's latest Investor Sentiment Survey.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\\"I don't have any problem with the views of the Fed being more dovish in 2024. It's what people expect in 2025 that started to be priced in, and the 31% year-to-year gain in the S&P 500. Everything just feels very frothy,\\\" he added.\"\n",

But we\\u2019ll never reach them if we don\\u2019t focus on the tough, pragmatic choices that will move us forward in the real world. To solve the climate crisis, we need to dive into the \\u201cmessy middle.\\u201d\\n\\nThe \\u201cmiddle\\u201d does not mean halfway, compromise measures. It\\u2019s way too late for that. The messy middle refers to the difficult decisions that need to be made, guided by science and hardheaded economics. It requires bridging the gap between scientific facts and human needs\\u2014and understanding the priorities of people who are impacted by this crisis and its solutions.\\n\\nThis approach to environmental action tends to produce results that can be sustained over time because they are aligned with real-world economic incentives. We\\u2019re not going to change human nature, so durable progress requires meeting people where they are and finding a path that works for them. It\\u2019s change that builds year over year, like compound interest.\\n\\nMethane matters\\n\\nA decade ago, we were in the midst of a heated debate about fracking. There were serious concerns about health human health and water pollution\\u2014but very little discussion about the climate impact of methane leaking from those wells and pipelines.\\n\\nResearchers have since uncovered that much more was leaking into the atmosphere than previously thought. And it turns out that fixing this problem is one of the fastest and most cost-effective ways to limit global warming in the short term.\\n\\nProgress required showing policymakers and companies the data, developing new technologies, and working with oil and gas companies who were willing to cut methane leaks\\u2014even if we environmentalists disagreed with them on other issues. Fifty major fossil fuel companies have now pledged to cut their pollution which could result in as much as an 80 to 90% reduction by 2030. They\\u2019ll be helped (and held accountable) by a new methane-detecting satellite that will provide open-source data to everyone\\n\\nThe same messy middle approach is underway with climate change and agriculture, which is responsible for approximately 40% of human-caused methane emissions. Dairy helps support the livelihoods and food needs of billions of people, including many of the most vulnerable, so today\\u2019s answer can\\u2019t simply be saying no to this global source of nutrition. Durable solutions require digging into the science and working with dairy farmers and industry in both low-income and high-income countries to limit emissions from their operations. We need to help farmers increase income, provide nutrition, and support the climate. And we have the solutions available today to achieve this.\\n\\nThe next big \\u2018messy middle\\u2019 challenges\\n\\nHydrogen, a potentially clean energy solution, is receiving billions in government and private support. While hydrogen has promise, its climate impacts depend very much on how it\\u2019s made, managed, and used\\u2014and whether it leaks. To reduce the emissions associated with hydrogen deployment, we must develop sensors, reduce leaks, and use hydrogen only when direct electrification isn\\u2019t a good fit.\\n\\nA similar debate is ongoing over carbon markets\\u2014a tool that allows companies to provide funds for climate solutions, such as tropical forests. While proponents point to the billions that could be generated to help developing nations fund clean economic growth, critics want to shut down these markets because of questions about the climate impact, integrity, and transparency of past projects. . The smart path for those who want faster climate action is to get markets right so the money can flow. That requires rigorous science to determine environmentally effective investments, strict accounting, and commitment that companies won\\u2019t use carbon markets to replace reducing their own pollution.\\n\\nI know this messy middle approach works because I\\u2019ve seen it in action. I spent much of my career trying to save our fisheries. When we began, fish populations in the U.S. were rapidly declining and boat crews were facing shorter and more dangerous seasons. The debate was so acrimonious that when I spoke about my research at meetings with fishermen, police stood by with their hands on their holsters.\\n\\nToday, after a lot of work in the messy middle, the U.S. has some of the best-managed fisheries in the world. This turnaround happened because we started being honest about the trade-offs of different solutions, prioritized improving people\\u2019s lives and environmental performance, and worked with those who made their living on the water.\\n\\nWhile solving the overfishing problem isn\\u2019t as complex as limiting climate change, it showed the way forward: embracing the messy middle, bridging from science to people, and working together for results. That\\u2019s the truly ambitious and practical path this crisis requires.\\n\\nMore must-read commentary published by Fortune:\\n\\nThe opinions expressed in Fortune.com commentary pieces are solely the views of their authors and do not necessarily reflect the opinions and beliefs of Fortune.\"\n",

This relief can come in many forms, including debt settlement, debt management plans, and debt consolidation. Each of these varies its approach to tackling this debt.\\n\\nFor example, with debt settlement, the credit card debt relief company will negotiate directly with creditors on behalf of consumers. They aim to reduce the total amount owed. A debt management plan will consolidate many payments into one single payment, all with the aim of having a lower interest rate. A debt consolidation loan will combine all of your outstanding credit card balances into one loan, preferably with a lower interest rate and a fixed repayment term.\\n\\nWhile each of these programs can offer credit card relief, many come with downsides. For example, debt settlement can lower your credit score, and debt consolidation loans often require good credit scores for the best interest rates. Credit card debt is unsecured debt, which means it\\u2019s not tied to an asset, such as your car or home, should you default. This means creditors are more likely to negotiate with you if you default and are often more flexible with repayment plans and settlement options compared to secured debt.\\n\\nTypes of unsecured debt\\n\\n\\u200b\\u200bUnsecured debt means your debt isn\\u2019t backed by an asset, such as a home or vehicle. Here\\u2019s a closer look at the different types of unsecured debt:\\n\\nCredit card debt: This is the most common type of unsecured debt and is where a consumer makes a purchase or takes a cash advance and doesn\\u2019t pay off the balance in full each month. As this debt isn\\u2019t secured by any specific asset, if the consumer defaults, the creditor can\\u2019t seize any property to recover what they owe.\\n\\nThis is the most common type of unsecured debt and is where a consumer makes a purchase or takes a cash advance and doesn\\u2019t pay off the balance in full each month. As this debt isn\\u2019t secured by any specific asset, if the consumer defaults, the creditor can\\u2019t seize any property to recover what they owe. Medical bills: While one may not think of a medical bill as an unsecured loan, consumers do get billed for unpaid expenses, such as hospital visits, surgeries, prescriptions, and other medical services. Because it\\u2019s not backed by collateral, it\\u2019s unsecured.\\n\\nWhile one may not think of a medical bill as an unsecured loan, consumers do get billed for unpaid expenses, such as hospital visits, surgeries, prescriptions, and other medical services. Because it\\u2019s not backed by collateral, it\\u2019s unsecured. Personal loan: A personal loan is based on the borrower\\u2019s creditworthiness and ability to repay the loan and isn\\u2019t backed by a physical asset. So, if the borrower defaults, the lender can\\u2019t repossess a property to recoup its losses.\\n\\nA personal loan is based on the borrower\\u2019s creditworthiness and ability to repay the loan and isn\\u2019t backed by a physical asset.

Private student loans: Although similar to federal loans, these aren\\u2019t backed by physical assets, which makes them unsecured debt.

While unsecured, there are still steep repercussions if unpaid, such as wage garnishment. Payday loans: These are short-term, high-interest loans that aren\\u2019t backed by any physical property. Instead, consumers repay them with their next paycheck. If they default, there are no real repercussions other than they can\\u2019t lend again.\\n\\nThese are short-term, high-interest loans that aren\\u2019t backed by any physical property. Instead, consumers repay them with their next paycheck. If they default, there are no real repercussions other than they can\\u2019t lend again. Utility bills: Any unpaid utility bills, such as electricity, gas, or water, are unsecured debt\\u2014usually. If the consumer defaults, property isn\\u2019t seized (unless there\\u2019s a deposit), but they can shut off services for nonpayment.\\n\\nSecured debt, on the other hand, is a type of debt that\\u2019s backed by collateral, such as a home or a car. If the borrower defaults, the lender can seize this collateral to recover the loan.\\n\\nExamples include:\\n\\nMortgage : If you default on a mortgage, the lender typically seizes the house via foreclosure.\\n\\n: If you default on a mortgage, the lender typically seizes the house via foreclosure.

Home equity loans/lines of credit: These are secured by the borrower\\u2019s home, which can also result in foreclosure.\\n\\nHow to choose a debt relief company for credit card debt\\n\\nChoosing the right type of credit card debt relief is the first step, and the next is to narrow it down to the debt relief company that can best help your situation. There are a lot of scammers out there who prey on people desperate for relief, so start by checking credentials and accreditation. The Better Business Bureau (BBB) may provide some fact-checking avenues for you, but organizations, such as the American Fair Credit Council (AFCC) or the International Associate of Professional Debt Arbitrators (IAPDA), may be a better source. This is because members of these organizations are required to adhere to industry standards and ethical practices.\\n\\nBefore signing up for any debt relief program, understand the fees involved. Legitimate companies are transparent in these fees and won\\u2019t ask for upfront payment before delivering results. Understand how long the process takes, what the steps are, and what impact it will have on your credit score, and if there are any potential legal ramifications. Here\\u2019s a quick list to look out for:\\n\\nAccreditation and credentials (BBB, AFCC, and IAPDA)\\n\\nTransparent fee structure (no upfront fees)\\n\\nPositive customer reviews and testimonials\\n\\nClear timeline for debt relief process\\n\\nImpact on credit score explained upfront\\n\\nPersonalized approach tailored to your financial needs\\n\\nAvailability in your state\\n\\nAlternatives to solutions for credit card debt\\n\\nBalance transfer credit cards: Some credit cards offer 0% APR for an introductory period\\u2014often six to 18 months.

Side hustles: When you\\u2019ve paired down all of your expenses, sometimes the only answer is to increase your income. Taking side jobs, freelancing, or doing gig work, such as Uber or Instacart can help you make extra payments toward your debt.\\n\\nOur methodology\\n\\nTo determine the five best debt relief companies for credit card debt, our team did a thorough qualitative analysis of dozens of debt relief companies. We analyzed the services offered, its published track record, industry reputation, customer reviews, accreditations, and its customer service.\\n\\nConsumer Reviews (40%): What actual consumers have to say about their experience with a debt relief company is taken into account heavily because dealing with the stress of debt cannot be understated. We looked at a number of consumer review sites, such as BBB, Trustpilot, and Google Reviews, to compile the score.\\n\\nCosts (30%): Anyone looking for debt relief should be focused on how much it will cost them to reduce their debt because, after all, it has to be worth it. That\\u2019s why we heavily weigh costs in our methodology.\\n\\nAverage time to settle debt (20%): Anyone with mounting debt should be concerned with how long it takes to settle and achieve debt-free financial freedom.\\n\\nFree consultation (5%): All debt relief companies should not charge you for your first consultation. It is against the laws of the FTC for them to take any upfront fees.\\n\\nAccreditations and types of debt services (5%): There are several relevant accreditations that debt relief companies can have. Those badges indicate the debt relief company is trained properly to offer you sound advice on how to manage or reduce your debts. We also weighed the types of debt services each company provides, such as debt settlement and debt consolidation.\\n\\nFrequently asked questions\\n\\nDoes credit card debt forgiveness hurt your credit? Yes, when debt is forgiven or settled for less than the full amount, this gets reported to credit bureaus as \\\"settled\\\" or \\\"paid for less than the full balance.\\\" This tells lenders that you didn't repay the full debt as agreed upon, though the impact this has on your credit score varies on your overall credit history and other factors.\\n\\nIs there a government credit card debt relief program? There is no specific government program solely for credit card debt relief other than filing for bankruptcy. Chapter 7 bankruptcy can discharge most unsecured debts, including credit card debt, though this has serious long-term consequences to both your credit score and your financial standing.\\n\\nIs there a program to write off credit card debt? There is no formal program to \\\"write off\\\" credit card debt. However, debt settlement programs can help you pay less than what you owe, though this typically results in consequences to your credit score and potential legal ramifications, such as tax liability on the forgiven debt. Bankruptcy is another legal process for unsecured debt, but this option can also have severe long-term consequences for your credit and financial health.\"\n",

ARM rates are sometimes lower than fixed rates initially, but be aware that your rate, and thus your monthly payment, can go up over time as the rate adjusts.\\n\\nAdjustable-rate mortgages, or ARMs, start with a fixed rate for a period of time.

FHA interest rates: Because FHA loans are a type of government-backed mortgage, their rates are typically lower than regular mortgage rates, making them more affordable for many borrowers. They also allow down payments of just 3.5%. But you'll need to pay FHA mortgage insurance for the life of the loan, which can be expensive compared to private mortgage insurance.\\n\\nBecause FHA loans are a type of government-backed mortgage, their rates are typically lower than regular mortgage rates, making them more affordable for many borrowers.

VA mortgage rates: This is also a type of government-backed mortgage. VA interest rates are often as low as or lower than FHA rates. VA loans also require no down payment and no mortgage insurance. But you'll need to be a military member or veteran to be eligible for one.\\n\\nThis is also a type of government-backed mortgage. VA interest rates are often as low as or lower than FHA rates.

Jumbo mortgage rates: If you need a mortgage that exceeds the conforming loan limit ($766,550 in 2024), you'll have to get a jumbo loan. Jumbo mortgage rates vary by lender, but they may be comparable to conforming loan rates.\\n\\nMortgage refinance\\n\\nMortgage refinance rates typically differ somewhat from purchase rates, and may be slightly higher \\u2014 particularly if you're getting a cash-out refinance, since these are considered riskier.\\n\\nIf you're considering a refinance, be sure to shop around with the best mortgage refinance lenders and get multiple rate quotes to be sure you're getting the best deal.\\n\\n30-year mortgage refinance rates: Refinancing into a 30-year term can lower your monthly payment since you're spreading out what you owe over a longer period of time. But you'll pay more in interest over the life of the loan.\\n\\nRefinancing into a 30-year term can lower your monthly payment since you're spreading out what you owe over a longer period of time. But you'll pay more in interest over the life of the loan. 15-year mortgage refinance rates: Refinancing into a shorter term like a 15-year mortgage will increase your monthly payment, but help you save on interest.\\n\\nYou can refinance into the same type of mortgage you have or a different type. For example, you can refinance from an ARM to another ARM, though many borrowers opt to refinance from an ARM to a fixed-rate mortgage when rates are down so they can lock in a low rate.\\n\\nRefinancing from a government-backed mortgage into that same type of mortgage is called a streamline refinance. These come with a simpler process and don't require an appraisal.\\n\\nHome equity line of credit (HELOC) and home equity loans\\n\\nHELOC rates and home equity loan rates are generally a little higher than rates on first mortgages, but they can still be worth it if you're looking to tap into your home's equity without having to take on a new rate on your main mortgage.\\n\\nAs with other types of mortgages, you'll want to shop around and get multiple rate quotes to find the best HELOC lenders or home equity loan lenders.\\n\\nAverage mortgage rate by credit score\\n\\nData from credit scoring company FICO shows that the lower your credit score, the more you'll pay in mortgage interest. Here's the average interest rate by credit level for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage of $300,000, as of October 2024:\\n\\nFICO Score National average mortgage APR 620 to 639 6.575% 640 to 659 6.566% 660 to 679 6.563% 680 to 699 6.560% 700 to 759 6.555% 760 to 850 6.547%\\n\\nAccording to FICO, only people with credit scores above 660 will truly see interest rates around the national average.\\n\\nMortgage rate outlook\\n\\nInflation has slowed significantly in the last couple of years, and the Federal Reserve recently started cutting rates. This has helped mortgage rates fall in recent months, and they're expected to go down further next year.\\n\\nExpert forecasts and potential rate changes\\n\\nExpert forecasts are generally predicting that mortgage rates will hold steady for the rest of 2024 and go down a bit in 2025. Fannie Mae's latest forecast, for example, sees mortgage rates ending this year at 6.20% and falling to 5.70% by the end of 2025. The Mortgage Bankers Association's outlook is similar, though it thinks rates will end 2025 at 5.80%.\\n\\nUltimately, how much rates fall depends on the Fed and how the economy evolves in the coming months and years.\\n\\nCurrent mortgage rates' impact on home prices and inventory\\n\\nHigh mortgage rates have kept home prices from rising too rapidly this year, and the pace of increases may slow next year. In August 2024, the median sales price for existing homes was $416,700, according to the National Association of Realtors.\\n\\nThe MBA predicts that home prices will be up 3.9% by the end of 2024 and 2.7% in 2025. Fannie Mae says they could end this year up 6.1% and increase 3% in 2025.\\n\\nFalling mortgage rates often increase demand and put upward pressure on home prices. But as rates go down, homeowners who have been waiting for lower rates may be more willing to list their homes, increasing inventory. This should help prices from rising too quickly.\\n\\nImpact of home interest rates on homebuyers and homeowners\\n\\nHow rates affect affordability and buying power\\n\\nYour rate has a direct impact on how much house you can afford. Snagging a lower rate can enable you to borrow more money, boosting your homebuying power.\\n\\nFor example, say you can afford to spend $2,000 per month on your mortgage payment (not including taxes and insurance). With a rate of 7%, you could borrow around $300,000. But with a 4% rate, you could afford to borrow as much as $400,000.\\n\\nStrategies for buying in varying rate environments\\n\\nIf you're buying when rates are high, you'll need to adjust your homebuying plans accordingly. You might need to lower your price range or make a larger down payment to achieve an affordable monthly payment.\\n\\nYou should also be careful about overspending in a low rate environment. Though you may be able to borrow a larger amount with a low rate, make sure you aren't stretching your budget too far. You don't necessarily need to borrow the full amount the mortgage lender approves you for.\\n\\nAbility to refinance\\n\\nHow current mortgage rates are trending doesn't only impact people thinking about buying. If you own your home and pay a mortgage, you might want to see if you can save money by refinancing.\\n\\nDeciding when to refinance your mortgage depends on both current rate trends and your own goals.\\n\\nIf mortgage rates today are lower than the rate on your mortgage, you could lower your monthly payment by refinancing. But refinancing costs money, so you'll want to make sure your monthly savings make it worthwhile.\\n\\nYou can also refinance to take cash out of your home. This can be beneficial if you need to pay for a big home repair or upgrade. But if it means taking on a higher interest rate, it might not be worth it.\\n\\nHow are mortgage rates determined?\\n\\nMultiple factors affect the interest rate you'll pay on a mortgage. Some are outside of your control. Others you can influence.\\n\\nIndividual factors influencing mortgage rates\\n\\nKey determining factors that you do have control over include:\\n\\nYour credit score Debt-to-income ratio The amount of your down payment The type of mortgage you get The length of your term\\n\\nThe better your finances, the better the rate you'll get. But remember that rates can also vary a lot depending on the type of mortgage you get. FHA rates are typically lower than conventional rates, for example. Or an ARM rate might be lower initially than a fixed rate, but you won't have the security of knowing your rate won't change over the years.\\n\\nRates also vary by lender, so be sure to comparison shop to ensure you get the best rate available (more on that further down).\\n\\nRole of the economy and government policies\\n\\nNo matter how good your finances are, you won't be able to get a rate that's dramatically lower than average. Rates are determined in large part by economic trends and how those trends affect investor demand for mortgage-backed securities. Geopolitical trends or uncertainties can also cause mortgage rates to swing up or down.\\n\\nWhen there's a lot of economic growth, mortgage rates typically go up. In recent years, high inflation has pushed mortgage rates up. When growth is slower, rates often go down.\\n\\nFederal Reserve policy can influence mortgage rates. When the Fed raises or lowers the federal funds rate, mortgage rates can move up or down as well based on how investors believe Fed changes will impact the broader economy.\\n\\nLately, mortgage rates have been very sensitive to inflation and labor market data. As this economic data has shifted market expectations around Fed rate cuts, mortgage rates have fluctuated.\\n\\nHow to get the best mortgage rate\\n\\nCompare mortgage rates\\n\\nOne of the best ways to score a good rate is to get approved with at least two or three different lenders and compare the rates they offer you. Rates can vary a lot by lender, and some mortgage lenders may be significantly more affordable than others.\\n\\nUse a mortgage calculator to see how different rates can impact your monthly payment. For example, on a $400,000 loan, a 6.70% rate results in a monthly payment of $2,581, while a 6.30% rate results in a monthly payment of $2,476 \\u2014 a more than $100 difference.\\n\\nLocking in the best rate\\n\\nOnce you've been approved for a mortgage, your lender may give you the option to lock in your rate. Since rates fluctuate every day, a rate lock ensures you keep your current rate and avoid increases before you close on your loan. However, if rates decrease after you lock your rate, you won't be able to take advantage of it unless your lender offers a float down option.\\n\\nYour loan officer can help you figure out when a good time to lock in your rate might be. Rate locks typically last between 30 and 90 days.\\n\\nBuying down your rate\\n\\nYou can also get a better rate by paying for one. By purchasing mortgage points (also called discount points), you'll lower your interest rate by a certain amount. A mortgage point costs 1% of the loan amount and lowers your rate by 0.25 percentage points.\\n\\nYou can also get a temporary buydown to lower your rate for a period of time. For example, a 2-1 buydown lowers your rate by two percentage points for the first year you have the loan, then by one percentage point for the second year. After that, the rate returns to normal.\\n\\nThe importance of credit scores and down payments\\n\\nYour credit score and down payment can greatly affect the price you'll pay to borrow a mortgage.\\n\\nThe higher your score is, the less you'll pay to borrow money. Generally, 620 is the minimum credit score needed to buy a house, with some exceptions for government-backed loans. You'll also need to make a down payment. Conventional loans require a minimum of 3% down, but putting down more can unlock a better rate.\\n\\nIf you're having trouble getting a good rate, you might want to work on improving your credit or saving for a larger down payment and reapply later.\\n\\nConsider fees and beneficial features\\n\\nYour interest rate is one of the most important things to consider when shopping for lenders, but it's not the only factor you should be looking at. You'll also pay fees to get a mortgage, and some lenders charge more than others.\\n\\nWhen you apply for a mortgage, you'll get a loan estimate that allows you to see the expected costs with a given lender. You can also look at the loan's APR, which factors in both your interest rate and the lender's fees.\\n\\nYou should consider whether a lender has features that you find beneficial as well. Some lenders offer more flexibility for borrowers with lower credit scores or no credit history. Others may be a good option for first-time homebuyers, offering down payment assistance or affordable mortgage programs for these types of buyers.\\n\\nCurrent mortgage rates FAQs\\n\\nWhat factors contribute to average mortgage rates?

The union called the strike after negotiations with the United States Maritime Alliance, a group that represents the workers' employers, failed to produce a contract deal.\\n\\nThe fallout from the strike on the economy will depend on how long it lasts. But the effects are potentially massive and far-reaching: The strike is affecting 36 ports from Maine to Texas, which normally move everything from fresh fruit to tires.\\n\\nHere's a rundown of all the ways the strike could impact the US.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThe strike could cost the US economy billions per day\\n\\nEconomic losses from the strike could cost the US economy between $3.8 billion and $4.5 billion per day, according to analysts at JPMorgan.\\n\\nIf the strike lasts more than two weeks, it could push inflation higher and lead to product shortages, Stifel analyst Bruce Chan said on Tuesday.\\n\\nShipping container companies including ZIM Integrated Shipping Services and Costamare saw their stock prices fall on Tuesday. Meanwhile, shares of FedEx and UPS have risen over the past week. Both companies offer air-freight services that could become valuable, if expensive, alternatives to ocean shipping.\\n\\nThe strike could even trigger a recession in the US if it lasts more than a month, said Alan Murphy, the CEO of the liner research firm Sea-Intelligence.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThe flow of consumer goods could halt just ahead of the holiday shopping season\\n\\nFresh fruit, beer, wine, and other imported groceries normally move through the ports as they make their way to shoppers at big-box chains and grocery stores.\\n\\nBut the strike could halt shipments of those foods, including mangoes, bananas, and other fresh fruit from Central and South America.\\n\\nRelated stories\\n\\nThe strike also comes at a tough time for retailers preparing for the holiday shopping season. Toy brands Lego and Playmobil typically rely on East Coast ports to bring products into the US, according to Jefferies analysts. Furniture, tires, and other durable goods could also be left sitting on ships, BI reported.\\n\\nRetailers have prepared for the strike by diverting some shipments to ports on the West Coast and bringing products in earlier, Jonathan Gold, the National Retail Federation's vice president of supply chain and customs policy, told BI.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nStill, \\\"even a minor disruption would have a negative impact and cause delays at a critical time for both retailers and consumers,\\\" he added.\\n\\nAuto parts and other manufacturing inputs could sit around at ports, delaying domestic production\\n\\nUS factories could also see their production lines slow down if the strike prevents them from getting parts from abroad.\\n\\nDomestic manufacturers of cars and pharmaceuticals could be among those hit, Mia Ginter, the director of ocean export products at the transportation company CH Robinson, wrote in August of a potential strike.\\n\\nThe strike is already a major issue for President Joe Biden\\n\\nTrade groups representing major US companies called on Biden to intervene and prevent a strike in the days leading up to the walkout.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nOn Tuesday, for example, the National Retail Federation said Biden should \\\"use any and all available authority and tools\\\" to resume normal operations at the ports, including invoking the Taft-Hartley Act, which allows the president to intervene during labor disputes that affect national security.\\n\\nMeanwhile, labor leaders have urged Biden to stay out of the negotiations, with Teamsters General President Sean M. O'Brien siding with the dockworkers and telling Biden to \\\"stay the f**k out of this fight and allow union workers to withhold their labor for the wages and benefits they have earned.\\\"\\n\\nBiden indicated Monday before the strike that he wouldn't step in.\\n\\n\\\"It's collective bargaining. I don't believe in Taft-Hartley,\\\" he said.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThe White House has said it's in contact with the International Longshoremen's Association and the United States Maritime Alliance to encourage a speedy resolution.\"\n",

Benchmark US West Texas Intermediate futures were 0.19% higher, at $68.32 per barrel.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nNotably, the gains followed a 17% decline in Brent and a 16% drop in US WTI futures over the third quarter of the year, when traders were on edge for upside price action amid the developments in the Middle East.\\n\\nThe reason isn't rocket science. It's mostly China \\u2014 the world's largest importer of crude oil.\\n\\n\\\"The main cause for the bearish sentiment has been a steady slowing of crude demand growth, especially in China,\\\" wrote Henning Gloystein, the practice head of energy, climate, and resources at the Eurasia Group, last month.\\n\\nThe world's second-largest economy has been struggling to stage a convincing recovery post-pandemic and is battling multiple challenges, including a property crisis, high youth unemployment, and deflation.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nBeijing pulled out an economic stimulus package last week that massively boosted sentiment in China's previously downbeat stock markets, but most analysts are saying the measures are just not enough to turn the situation around on the ground.\\n\\nEven Chinese leader Xi Jinping acknowledged the extent of China's problems in the country's National Day speech on Monday, saying the path forward wouldn't be smooth.\\n\\nRelated stories\\n\\nBMI, a research firm, wrote last week that short positions in Brent outnumbered longs for the first time earlier in September.\\n\\n\\\"Sentiment in the market is already weak, with a bearish macro narrative weighing heavily to the downside, and investors are currently far more responsive to bearish price drivers than to bullish ones,\\\" wrote BMI's analysts.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThe sentiment over China has been so poor that Saudi Arabia has pretty much thrown in the towel on pushing oil higher.\\n\\nThe kingdom \\u2014 which is the world's largest crude exporter and OPEC's de facto leader \\u2014 is giving up its $100 per barrel price target and ready to increase oil output, the Financial Times reported last week.\\n\\nThis means that Saudi Arabia is looking to corner a larger market share instead of targeting higher profit margins by restricting output.\\n\\nThis would be a big shift in policy, since Saudi Arabia has been leading OPEC and the group's allies, including Russia, in maintaining oil supply cuts since late 2022.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nDespite the downside pressure on oil prices, things could change quickly if geopolitical uncertainty rises further in the Middle East.\\n\\nThe US may also provide some support to the market as crude oil inventories hit a two-and-a-half year low as of September 20, the latest data available.\\n\\n\\\"Yes, it is true that traders are worried about the fact that Chinese demand for oil is not back yet to a level that can make the OPEC stop extending the supply cut process,\\\" wrote Naeem Aslam, the CIO at London-based Zaye Capital Markets.\\n\\n\\\"However, the fact that the US oil stockpiles are clearing more quickly indicates that the demand for oil in the world's largest economy is trending in the right direction, which is positive for price action,\\\" Aslam added.\"\n",

Finding mentorship and the right guidance was a challenge, too.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nEveryone around Hassan told him that going to the US for a master's degree was the next big opportunity. So he did.\\n\\nOver the next 16 years, he put his startup plans on hold and worked at some of the world's biggest companies, including Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta.\\n\\nNithin Hassan lived in the US for 15 years before returning to India last year. Nithin Hassan\\n\\nBut the pandemic felt like a turning point. And its aftermath made India look like a lab-designed business environment: It had just become the world's most populous country, the pandemic had created pent-up demand for consumer products, and growing internet adoption made commerce more scalable, he said.\\n\\nSo Hassan left behind about $500,000 in annual pay at Meta to move back to Bengaluru in December 2023 with his wife and two children. He has since launched two startups.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nHassan is part of a group of expat Indians moving back home to venture out on their own. As such, he's also part of a decades-long trend of reverse migration back to India.\\n\\nThe trend began in the 1990s and picked up at the turn of the century, driven by the economic collapse in 2008, said Binod Khadria, the president of Global Research Forum on Diaspora and Transnationalism. Many of those who returned to India for work were largely working for multinational companies.\\n\\nToday, the impetus for the move often looks a bit different: It's driven by factors like unstable visa policies and economic recessions, which lead to uncertainty when it comes to jobs and duration of stay in these destinations.\\n\\nMany returnees find work in tech, but the finance, retail, and climate sectors also absorb a large number of expat Indians, Khadia said. And some of the returnees are heading back to India to start companies of their own.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nIndia is undergoing a startup explosion. The country reported over 140,800 recognized startups at the end of June \\u2014 nearly 50,000 more than last year \\u2014 and credited them with creating 1.6 million direct jobs.\\n\\nTo be sure, not all of these companies will make it big \\u2014 and some do still stumble, like Oyo and Byju's. But the chaos, where even established startups are trying and failing, makes India a fair playing field for new entrants, Hassan said.\\n\\nBusiness Insider spoke to six founders about why they have recently returned to India after spending several years, or even an adult life, abroad.\\n\\nFastest-growing economy\\n\\nThe health of the economy and interest from investors are fueling the entrepreneurship boom.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nIndia's economic growth in 2023 \\u2014 8.2% \\u2014 was the fastest of all large economies worldwide. That's led to greater purchasing power, which lets companies, including startups, sell more.\\n\\nIndia's inflation rate of about 3.5% is well below its annual wage growth of 9.6%. This makes inflation less of a challenge than it is for slower-growing peers, where consumer-focused businesses have been hurt by high prices.\\n\\nRelated stories\\n\\nInvestors are getting in on the action.\\n\\nFrom 2015 to 2021, the number of unique investors in India nearly quadrupled, though the number is tracking much lower this year, per PitchBook.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\\"Other than a slight downturn in 2022 and 2023 due to global macroeconomic factors, VC funding has been consistently growing in India,\\\" said Ben Mathias, a managing partner at Vertex Ventures Southeast Asia & India.\\n\\nBesides funding, domestic developments have encouraged founders and VCs too, Mathias said.\\n\\nThe Indian government's Universal Payment Interface system has spurred consumers and businesses to pay online, and 40% of all digital payments globally happen in India today, the partner said.\\n\\nPrograms like Startup India, which provides founders benefits like tax exemption, easier compliance, and funding support, have made creating a company smoother.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nDevyani Parameshwar worked in the microfinance and fintech space in India in the 2010s before heading to the UK and Africa. She returned to India in 2022 to launch a financial management venture.\\n\\n\\\"It's changed dramatically. I remember standing in line at various ministries in Delhi trying to get meetings and then trying to get answers and it wasn't easy in the past,\\\" she said of her memories of India.\\n\\nNow, she can use an online platform to ask the country's central bank and banking regulator questions.\\n\\nIt's easier than ever for foreign companies to invest in India, which means startups have a clearer exit path through acquisition \\u2014 something VCs think hard about before entering new markets or writing checks.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nMarket ripe for the taking\\n\\nFor Rohan Bhide, who spent most of his college and professional life preparing to launch something of his own, a trip home in 2017 while he was studying in the US was a turning point.\\n\\nIndian telecom giant Reliance had recently launched a cheap unlimited data plan, which spiked Indian internet adoption. India was charting among the countries with the highest online transactions.\\n\\n\\\"That really, really drew my attention,\\\" said Bhide, who worked at Meta after graduation. \\\"It was my dream come true \\u2014 a huge market, a huge user base, and at the same time, the ability to adopt technology was incredible.\\\"\\n\\nBhide returned to India in January, leaving behind about $580,000 in total compensation at ticketing platform StubHub. He and a cofounder are working on launching a consumer tech product later this year.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nRohan Bhide returned to India in January after working at Meta and StubHub in the US. Rohan Bhide\\n\\nMost Indians grew up wanting to work at a multinational company \\u2014 but that's changing, Bhide said.\\n\\nRelated stories\\n\\nFreelancing, running your own business, or working for a startup is much more socially acceptable now, because people see the success of other Indian startups. The country has the third-largest number of \\\"unicorns\\\" \\u2014 companies worth $1 billion or more \\u2014 with 64, per PitchBook.\\n\\nBoom in entrepreneurship culture\\n\\nA lot has changed since Hassan first wanted to launch his hardware startup in the early 2000s.\\n\\nTech hot spots like Bengaluru and Gurugram have seen a boom in entrepreneurship culture in the last few years, with meet-ups, networking mixers, and even morning walks with like-minded builders.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nDhruv Anand launched an AI services startup after moving back to India. Dhruv Anand\\n\\nDhruv Anand, who left Google in the US to move back to India in 2021 to launch an AI startup, said that there were lots of other founders and mentors to help guide him.\\n\\n\\\"If you want to figure out who's the right chartered accountant to talk to, who's the right lawyer to help you draft agreements, all of that stuff is very easy,\\\" Anand said.\\n\\n\\\"It's been a really, really supportive community,\\\" Bhide said. There are people \\\"telling you about their entire lives just because they want to help you and they're hoping that you pass the favor onto the next person who moves to India and wants to start their own company.\\\"\\n\\nNot everything is perfect\\n\\nAlthough these founders made the decision to return to India, that doesn't mean they no longer see the benefits of operating in the US.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nRuchit Garg founded an agriculture startup in Silicon Valley in 2016, with a focus on supporting farmers around the globe. In 2019, he returned to India, where his late grandfather worked as a farmer.\\n\\nGarg has been building in India ever since, but he says its startup ecosystem cannot yet compete with the Valley's decades of experience.\\n\\n\\\"The overall ecosystem was more mature back in Silicon Valley. It's still one of the best places for entrepreneurs. India isn't there yet, although it's growing pretty drastically,\\\" he said.\\n\\nDespite efforts to digitalize key processes, many bureaucratic challenges persist.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nFor most founders, after living in US cities where populations are a fraction of those in Mumbai and Bangalore, congested roads and poorer air quality are also everyday annoyances.\\n\\nBut India provides some big perks, including affordable domestic help and the appeal of building solutions for problems they witness firsthand.\\n\\n\\\"It's a different joy to be able to build for problems that you feel for very personally,\\\" Parameshwar, the fintech founder, said. When she worked in Africa, she needed translators. Now, she can speak with her users herself.\\n\\nFor some founders, being surrounded by family and the culture they grew up in was another selling point.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nNiranjan Vemulkar moved back to India in 2015 and later founded a digital legacy planning platform.\\n\\nHe said that he never fully felt at home in the US, where he lived for over a decade.\\n\\n\\\"For us, it was the fact that we wanted to raise a family in an environment where the children would have access to the grandparents and Indian culture,\\\" Vemulkar said. \\\"The fact that you could come back to India, start something of your own and figure things out in an ecosystem which was potentially booming for startups, was just a cherry on the cake.\\\"\\n\\nAre you in India and have a story to share about the tech and entrepreneurship landscape?

It already is by our criteria, with the relevant question being whether these conditions will continue, not whether they will materialize.\\n\\n\\u201cThe odds continue to rise for this bull-case scenario, with many recent developments on the demand side, supply side, and monetary policy all supportive.\\u201d\\n\\nInvestors are increasingly coming around to a soft-landing consensus, he added.\\n\\nA September survey of 37 economists from the Financial Times found the majority did not expect to see a contraction in the next couple of years.\\n\\nThe survey\\u2014and its optimistic outlook\\u2014took place ahead of the Fed\\u2019s anticipated rate cut last month, which markets have since seen as a rebalancing toward the unemployment side of the Federal Open Market Committee\\u2019s (FOMC) mandate, thus ensuring a level of productivity and activity.\\n\\n\\u201cThe way things have been trending, it\\u2019s quite possible that by early 2025 only the most pessimistic investors will need rose-colored glasses to see a clear path to a Roaring \\u201820s outcome,\\u201d Draho added.\\n\\nPowell\\u2019s 2% target\\n\\nDraho outlined UBS\\u2019s criteria to officially declare the 2020s a \\u201cRoaring \\u201920s\\u201d: sustained GDP growth of 2.5% or higher, inflation in the 2-3% range, a Fed funds rate around 3.5%, and the 10-year Treasury yield around 4%.\\n\\nAccording to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, real GDP for Q2 2024 increased at an annual rate of 3%\\u2014ticking the first box.\\n\\nFollowing Jerome Powell\\u2019s intense wrangle with inflation, the 12-month CPI percentage for August 2024 came in at 2.5%\\u2014ticking the second box.\\n\\nThe fed funds rate\\u2014despite a higher-than-expected cut last month\\u2014sits above UBS\\u2019s threshold at 4.75% to 5%.\\n\\nAnd in a bid to foster employment\\u2014and as a result productivity and consumer spending\\u2014Draho believes the Fed might have to compromise on its target inflation rate of 2%.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s a notion the likes of JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon has already floated, with Draho adding: \\u201cThe relevance for the Roaring \\u201920s outcome is that the Fed signaled a strong desire to preserve the soft landing and maintain full employment, even if it means inflation descends more gradually back to 2%.\\u201d\\n\\nThe FOMC would never publicly admit it would accept inflation above 2%, Draho added but countered: \\u201cA 50bps rate cut is not an explicit signal that the Fed is targeting this outcome, but the bread crumbs suggest a policy reaction function that is directionally supportive of a Roaring \\u201920s outcome.\\u201d\\n\\nUnemployment is the sticking point\\n\\nRising unemployment has been the factor which has caused even the more hawkish members of the FOMC to pause.\\n\\nThe Sahm Rule\\u2014which in the past has been accurate in predicting when an economy will enter a recession\\u2014was triggered back in July.\\n\\nThe Sahm Rule looks at two factors: the current three-month moving average of U.S. unemployment and the lowest three-month moving average of U.S. unemployment over the past year.\\n\\nIf the current average is higher than the lowest average by more than half a percentage point, the American economy is headed for a recession. Its latest reading for August sits at 0.57 pp.\\n\\nDraho admits that the labor market could prove to be the snag in America\\u2019s return to an economic heyday, writing: \\u201cCooling over the past six months has done more than just rebalance the labor market, it has left it looser than it was pre-pandemic.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThe U.S. election and the escalating war in the Middle East are also sources of potential risks,\\u201d adds Draho.\\n\\nOf course, the original Roaring \\u201920s had their end as well. The Great Depression kicked off with the Black Tuesday Wall Street stock market crash in October 1929.\"\n",

There are many different types of mortgages you can get, and all come with their own typical rates. A few of the most popular types include:\\n\\n30-year mortgage rates: The most popular type of mortgage, this fixed-rate home loan makes for low monthly payments by spreading the amount over 30 years. Because the rate is fixed, your interest rate won't change over the life of the loan. But 30-year mortgages have higher average rates compared to loans with shorter terms.\\n\\nThe most popular type of mortgage, this fixed-rate home loan makes for low monthly payments by spreading the amount over 30 years.

It has higher monthly payments since payments are spread over a shorter period of time.

ARM rates: Adjustable-rate mortgages, or ARMs, start with a fixed rate for a period of time. After that, your rate can change once or twice a year. ARM rates are sometimes lower than fixed rates initially, but be aware that your rate, and thus your monthly payment, can go up over time as the rate adjusts.\\n\\nAdjustable-rate mortgages, or ARMs, start with a fixed rate for a period of time. After that, your rate can change once or twice a year. ARM rates are sometimes lower than fixed rates initially, but be aware that your rate, and thus your monthly payment, can go up over time as the rate adjusts. FHA interest rates: Because FHA loans are a type of government-backed mortgage, their rates are typically lower than regular mortgage rates, making them more affordable for many borrowers. They also allow down payments of just 3.5%. But you'll need to pay FHA mortgage insurance for the life of the loan, which can be expensive compared to private mortgage insurance.\\n\\nBecause FHA loans are a type of government-backed mortgage, their rates are typically lower than regular mortgage rates, making them more affordable for many borrowers.

VA mortgage rates: This is also a type of government-backed mortgage. VA interest rates are often as low as or lower than FHA rates. VA loans also require no down payment and no mortgage insurance. But you'll need to be a military member or veteran to be eligible for one.\\n\\nThis is also a type of government-backed mortgage. VA interest rates are often as low as or lower than FHA rates. VA loans also require no down payment and no mortgage insurance. But you'll need to be a military member or veteran to be eligible for one. Jumbo mortgage rates: If you need a mortgage that exceeds the conforming loan limit ($766,550 in 2024), you'll have to get a jumbo loan. Jumbo mortgage rates vary by lender, but they may be comparable to conforming loan rates.\\n\\nMortgage refinance\\n\\nMortgage refinance rates typically differ somewhat from purchase rates, and may be slightly higher \\u2014 particularly if you're getting a cash-out refinance, since these are considered riskier.\\n\\nIf you're considering a refinance, be sure to shop around with the best mortgage refinance lenders and get multiple rate quotes to be sure you're getting the best deal.\\n\\n30-year mortgage refinance rates: Refinancing into a 30-year term can lower your monthly payment since you're spreading out what you owe over a longer period of time. But you'll pay more in interest over the life of the loan.\\n\\nRefinancing into a 30-year term can lower your monthly payment since you're spreading out what you owe over a longer period of time. But you'll pay more in interest over the life of the loan. 15-year mortgage refinance rates: Refinancing into a shorter term like a 15-year mortgage will increase your monthly payment, but help you save on interest.\\n\\nYou can refinance into the same type of mortgage you have or a different type. For example, you can refinance from an ARM to another ARM, though many borrowers opt to refinance from an ARM to a fixed-rate mortgage when rates are down so they can lock in a low rate.\\n\\nRefinancing from a government-backed mortgage into that same type of mortgage is called a streamline refinance. These come with a simpler process and don't require an appraisal.\\n\\nHome equity line of credit (HELOC) and home equity loans\\n\\nHELOC rates and home equity loan rates are generally a little higher than rates on first mortgages, but they can still be worth it if you're looking to tap into your home's equity without having to take on a new rate on your main mortgage.\\n\\nAs with other types of mortgages, you'll want to shop around and get multiple rate quotes to find the best HELOC lenders or home equity loan lenders.\\n\\nAverage mortgage rate by credit score\\n\\nData from credit scoring company FICO shows that the lower your credit score, the more you'll pay in mortgage interest. Here's the average interest rate by credit level for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage of $300,000, as of October 2024:\\n\\nFICO Score National average mortgage APR 620 to 639 6.575% 640 to 659 6.566% 660 to 679 6.563% 680 to 699 6.560% 700 to 759 6.555% 760 to 850 6.547%\\n\\nAccording to FICO, only people with credit scores above 660 will truly see interest rates around the national average.\\n\\nMortgage rate outlook\\n\\nInflation has slowed significantly in the last couple of years, and the Federal Reserve recently started cutting rates. This has helped mortgage rates fall in recent months, and they're expected to go down further next year.\\n\\nExpert forecasts and potential rate changes\\n\\nExpert forecasts are generally predicting that mortgage rates will hold steady for the rest of 2024 and go down a bit in 2025. Fannie Mae's latest forecast, for example, sees mortgage rates ending this year at 6.20% and falling to 5.70% by the end of 2025. The Mortgage Bankers Association's outlook is similar, though it thinks rates will end 2025 at 5.80%.\\n\\nUltimately, how much rates fall depends on the Fed and how the economy evolves in the coming months and years.\\n\\nCurrent mortgage rates' impact on home prices and inventory\\n\\nHigh mortgage rates have kept home prices from rising too rapidly this year, and the pace of increases may slow next year. In August 2024, the median sales price for existing homes was $416,700, according to the National Association of Realtors.\\n\\nThe MBA predicts that home prices will be up 3.9% by the end of 2024 and 2.7% in 2025. Fannie Mae says they could end this year up 6.1% and increase 3% in 2025.\\n\\nFalling mortgage rates often increase demand and put upward pressure on home prices. But as rates go down, homeowners who have been waiting for lower rates may be more willing to list their homes, increasing inventory. This should help prices from rising too quickly.\\n\\nImpact of home interest rates on homebuyers and homeowners\\n\\nHow rates affect affordability and buying power\\n\\nYour rate has a direct impact on how much house you can afford. Snagging a lower rate can enable you to borrow more money, boosting your homebuying power.\\n\\nFor example, say you can afford to spend $2,000 per month on your mortgage payment (not including taxes and insurance). With a rate of 7%, you could borrow around $300,000. But with a 4% rate, you could afford to borrow as much as $400,000.\\n\\nStrategies for buying in varying rate environments\\n\\nIf you're buying when rates are high, you'll need to adjust your homebuying plans accordingly. You might need to lower your price range or make a larger down payment to achieve an affordable monthly payment.\\n\\nYou should also be careful about overspending in a low rate environment. Though you may be able to borrow a larger amount with a low rate, make sure you aren't stretching your budget too far. You don't necessarily need to borrow the full amount the mortgage lender approves you for.\\n\\nAbility to refinance\\n\\nHow current mortgage rates are trending doesn't only impact people thinking about buying. If you own your home and pay a mortgage, you might want to see if you can save money by refinancing.\\n\\nDeciding when to refinance your mortgage depends on both current rate trends and your own goals.\\n\\nIf mortgage rates today are lower than the rate on your mortgage, you could lower your monthly payment by refinancing. But refinancing costs money, so you'll want to make sure your monthly savings make it worthwhile.\\n\\nYou can also refinance to take cash out of your home. This can be beneficial if you need to pay for a big home repair or upgrade. But if it means taking on a higher interest rate, it might not be worth it.\\n\\nHow are mortgage rates determined?\\n\\nMultiple factors affect the interest rate you'll pay on a mortgage. Some are outside of your control. Others you can influence.\\n\\nIndividual factors influencing mortgage rates\\n\\nKey determining factors that you do have control over include:\\n\\nYour credit score Debt-to-income ratio The amount of your down payment The type of mortgage you get The length of your term\\n\\nThe better your finances, the better the rate you'll get. But remember that rates can also vary a lot depending on the type of mortgage you get. FHA rates are typically lower than conventional rates, for example. Or an ARM rate might be lower initially than a fixed rate, but you won't have the security of knowing your rate won't change over the years.\\n\\nRates also vary by lender, so be sure to comparison shop to ensure you get the best rate available (more on that further down).\\n\\nRole of the economy and government policies\\n\\nNo matter how good your finances are, you won't be able to get a rate that's dramatically lower than average. Rates are determined in large part by economic trends and how those trends affect investor demand for mortgage-backed securities. Geopolitical trends or uncertainties can also cause mortgage rates to swing up or down.\\n\\nWhen there's a lot of economic growth, mortgage rates typically go up. In recent years, high inflation has pushed mortgage rates up. When growth is slower, rates often go down.\\n\\nFederal Reserve policy can influence mortgage rates. When the Fed raises or lowers the federal funds rate, mortgage rates can move up or down as well based on how investors believe Fed changes will impact the broader economy.\\n\\nLately, mortgage rates have been very sensitive to inflation and labor market data. As this economic data has shifted market expectations around Fed rate cuts, mortgage rates have fluctuated.\\n\\nHow to get the best mortgage rate\\n\\nCompare mortgage rates\\n\\nOne of the best ways to score a good rate is to get approved with at least two or three different lenders and compare the rates they offer you. Rates can vary a lot by lender, and some mortgage lenders may be significantly more affordable than others.\\n\\nUse a mortgage calculator to see how different rates can impact your monthly payment. For example, on a $400,000 loan, a 6.70% rate results in a monthly payment of $2,581, while a 6.30% rate results in a monthly payment of $2,476 \\u2014 a more than $100 difference.\\n\\nLocking in the best rate\\n\\nOnce you've been approved for a mortgage, your lender may give you the option to lock in your rate. Since rates fluctuate every day, a rate lock ensures you keep your current rate and avoid increases before you close on your loan. However, if rates decrease after you lock your rate, you won't be able to take advantage of it unless your lender offers a float down option.\\n\\nYour loan officer can help you figure out when a good time to lock in your rate might be. Rate locks typically last between 30 and 90 days.\\n\\nBuying down your rate\\n\\nYou can also get a better rate by paying for one. By purchasing mortgage points (also called discount points), you'll lower your interest rate by a certain amount. A mortgage point costs 1% of the loan amount and lowers your rate by 0.25 percentage points.\\n\\nYou can also get a temporary buydown to lower your rate for a period of time. For example, a 2-1 buydown lowers your rate by two percentage points for the first year you have the loan, then by one percentage point for the second year. After that, the rate returns to normal.\\n\\nThe importance of credit scores and down payments\\n\\nYour credit score and down payment can greatly affect the price you'll pay to borrow a mortgage.\\n\\nThe higher your score is, the less you'll pay to borrow money. Generally, 620 is the minimum credit score needed to buy a house, with some exceptions for government-backed loans. You'll also need to make a down payment. Conventional loans require a minimum of 3% down, but putting down more can unlock a better rate.\\n\\nIf you're having trouble getting a good rate, you might want to work on improving your credit or saving for a larger down payment and reapply later.\\n\\nConsider fees and beneficial features\\n\\nYour interest rate is one of the most important things to consider when shopping for lenders, but it's not the only factor you should be looking at. You'll also pay fees to get a mortgage, and some lenders charge more than others.\\n\\nWhen you apply for a mortgage, you'll get a loan estimate that allows you to see the expected costs with a given lender. You can also look at the loan's APR, which factors in both your interest rate and the lender's fees.\\n\\nYou should consider whether a lender has features that you find beneficial as well. Some lenders offer more flexibility for borrowers with lower credit scores or no credit history. Others may be a good option for first-time homebuyers, offering down payment assistance or affordable mortgage programs for these types of buyers.\\n\\nCurrent mortgage rates FAQs\\n\\nWhat factors contribute to average mortgage rates?

It has been edited for length and clarity.\\n\\nBy the time my son was in seventh grade, he was struggling with an addiction to technology. As a psychologist, I had questioned in the past whether phones and computers could truly be addictive. But when I saw my son experiencing withdrawal symptoms and lying to get more screen time, I realized they could be \\u2014 and it was happening right in my house.\\n\\nOnce I realized my son had a serious challenge, my wife and I made a plan to limit his use of technology, which included locking up all devices in the house at night. But we faced another challenge: school.\\n\\nAt my son's school, like most these days, all students had laptops. There are a lot of benefits to using technology in the classroom, but for some kids, like my son, having a computer isn't an advantage.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nWe started with an open conversation with the school\\n\\nI knew I wanted my son to have less access to technology at school. But I also realized that by removing the thing that was challenging (the computer), I was creating a whole set of new challenges. Since I'm not in the classroom, I probably didn't even know what some of those unintended consequences were.\\n\\nRelated stories\\n\\nMy wife and I didn't know what the right answer was and didn't claim to, so we asked for a meeting with the school. My son has autism and ADHD, so he has an individualized education program (IEP). That gave us a big advantage because the school had to listen to our concerns. Plus, we already had an established means of communicating with them and trust with my son's educational team.\\n\\nWe realized we needed a fluid approach\\n\\nAt home, we could simply lock up computers and phones when our son had reached his screen time limit. For school, we knew it wouldn't necessarily be as simple.\\n\\nInstead, we came to his teachers with a statement: We want to limit his access to his computer as much as possible while still supporting his learning. We asked what sorts of other systems we could implement within that framework. The details varied from class to class.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nWe went back to paper and pencil\\n\\nWhenever possible, my son did his assignments with paper and pencil. For math problems or essay writing, this was fine. Yet we soon found there were assignments he simply couldn't do without a computer \\u2014 like watching a given video and writing a response.\\n\\nIn those situations, my son got access to his computer, with monitoring. For most of the day, his computer stayed in the resource teacher's room, and he only got it when he absolutely needed it.\\n\\nImplementing this was hard, but worth it\\n\\nI knew reducing the reliance on tech at school wouldn't be easy, yet I was still surprised at just how difficult it was. We had a huge advantage: because of my son's IEP, we had a resource teacher we could always reach out to. Even so, limiting computer time required an enormous amount of communication with teachers, as well as adjusting on the fly based on the type of assignments my son had and how he was managing his tech addiction at a given time.\\n\\nToday, my son is doing a lot better with his recovery from tech addiction. He's in ninth grade now, and he has shown he can be trusted to use computers responsibly. Because of that, we haven't had to talk with his high school teachers about limiting technology. We may need to in the future though.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAs a professional, it is a bit concerning to me how hard it was to ease off technology use in school. There are an increasing number of kids who are addicted to technology, like my son. At the same time, we're making these same devices a key ingredient of learning. It's a very complex problem, and it will take us some time as a society to figure out how to solve it. In the meantime, a lot falls on parents and teachers to find the right answer for individual kids.\"\n",

The idea is that older people who drink ketone esters \\u2014 supplements designed to help the body run on ketones instead of sugar \\u2014 might be able to gain some renewed pep in their step.\\n\\nKetones already have a lot of street cred with Silicon Valley biohackers, who celebrate them as the body's \\\"preferred\\\" energy source because they're what our bodies use for fuel when we're fasting or when we don't have enough glucose circulating to keep all of our organs humming along.\\n\\n\\\"Actually, they're the preferred backup,\\\" Brianna Stubbs, the director of translational science at the Buck Institute, told Business Insider.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nKetones are what our body generally burns when it doesn't have enough carbs at the ready. \\\"Whenever there are ketones in the blood, the body will use that as energy in preference to sugar,\\\" she said.\\n\\nWhen ketones are coursing through a person's bloodstream, they're said to be \\\"in ketosis\\\" because ketones \\u2014 and not glucose \\u2014 are providing the fuel for their cells.\\n\\nRelated stories\\n\\nKetosis is a tool that evolved to protect our brains and bodies from damage during periods of famine. Scientists think this natural ketone metabolism safety switch we've developed could also be harnessed for healthy aging, because a number of organs, including the brain, become less efficient at using sugar for fuel as we age.\\n\\nThe nationwide study that Stubbs and her mentor, Dr. John Newman, are launching will aim to measure whether older people drinking ketone shots become less frail, with better walking scores, or experience improvements in energy, cognition, or mood.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nKetone drinks are not ketogenic diets in a bottle\\n\\nPeople in the study will drink this creamy, tropical shot twice daily for five months. Juvenescence\\n\\nFasting, low-carb, high-fat diets like keto, and drinking ketone esters can all prompt ketones to circulate in a person's blood. But they don't get to that end result in the same way.\\n\\nKetone ester drinks don't require the liver to convert fat into ketones, which is what happens with fasting and the keto diet. Instead, they deliver ketones straight to the stomach and the liver, where they are processed and pushed out into the bloodstream.\\n\\n\\\"If you were wanting to lose weight, you want to be burning your own fat and turning it into ketones,\\\" Stubbs said. Ketone drinks don't do that. \\\"You have not burned your own fat to make those ketones. It's not a shortcut.\\\"\\n\\nFor several years, scientists thought ketone drinks might be good for athletic performance, taken as a pre-race drink. Even the US military invested in the idea. But more recently, Stubbs and other athletes have coalesced around the idea that ketone esters are better tools for athletic recovery.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThat's how the former Olympic rower uses them. Stubbs recently completed a six-day, 380-kilometer ultramarathon through the craggy mountains of Wales. During her rest stops, she drank ketone esters alongside carbs and protein. She hopes this strategy helps her body recover after hard workouts, maintaining muscle and vigor.\\n\\nElite athletes sometimes use ketone esters for recovery. Stubbs drinks them after races, alongside a snack that includes some carbs and protein. Pavel1964/Shutterstock\\n\\nBecause older people already have more trouble using sugar, there's also some hope that ketone esters might be good for helping their bodies maintain strength, potentially reducing inflammation, boosting mood, and improving cognitive function. But that all remains to be seen.\\n\\nIndependent fasting and ketosis expert Mark Mattson, former head of the National Institute on Aging's neuroscience lab, said the study is \\\"worth trying.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"There is some rationale for why it might help, and it's very safe,\\\" he told Business Insider.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nMattson's excited to see what kind of effect these drinkable ketones might have on aging brains in particular, since they are more susceptible to cognitive impairment and diseases like Parkinson's.\\n\\nBut he also says getting into ketosis through other techniques like intermittent fasting has extra benefits for the body and the brain that shouldn't be discounted.\\n\\nIn an initial pilot study Stubbs recently completed at the Buck, ketone drinks appeared safe for adults over 65 when tested during a four-month period. The most common complaints were nausea and upset stomachs, which are common issues with ketosis, even when achieved through fasting or low-carb diets.\\n\\nThe new, bigger trial will be a five-month study of 180 adults over 65 years old in California, Connecticut, and Ohio, testing whether ketone esters might help with frailty. Recruitment starts in November.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nIn order to test whether a ketone drink might actually be helpful for aging, Stubbs is aiming to recruit \\\"people who would probably self-describe as slowing down,\\\" she said. Maybe these days, walking two blocks is more of a challenge for them than it used to be.\\n\\nResults from the study won't likely be available until 2028, Stubbs said. Assuming positive outcomes eventually surface, she imagines a future in which an older adult who's losing muscle and starting to experience cognitive decline might have a ketone drink every morning and night. But she also says that any eventual geriatric recommendation for ketone esters isn't likely to be one-size-fits-all.\\n\\n\\\"If I had my super fit, healthy 90-year-old who took one statin and that was it, and she had no other problems and everything was functioning fine for her, I'd be like, 'Well, you're just adding something else in there that maybe you don't need,'\\\" Stubbs said.\"\n",

As long as three positive catalysts continue to boost the market, there's no reason stocks can't climb higher, NDR said in a note this week.\\n\\nOf the 13 bull markets that lasted for at least two years since 1949, stocks have continued to climb higher for a third year unless the economy entered a downturn or encountered a Black Swan event, such as the sovereign debt crisis in Europe, or the US credit downgrade in 2011, the firm said.\\n\\nIn one instance, the bull market ended after the Fed reversed its rate cut decision, spooking investors.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nBull markets tend to last for at least three years if stocks avoid a negative catalyst, strategists said. Ned Davis Research\\n\\n\\\"Bull markets do not die of old age,\\\" strategists wrote. \\\"The table underscores our view that absent a Fed policy error, hard landing, or external shock, the path of least resistance is a continuation of the bull market.\\\"\\n\\nOf all the bull markets that lasted for at least three years since 1949, stocks gained a median 13.1% in their third year, Ned Davis Research said.\\n\\nThe S&P 500 has gained 60% since the index entered bull market territory in October 2022. Those gains have largely been on the back of three positive catalysts, the firm said, suggesting that stocks could continue to do well as long as the positive factors remained in play.\\n\\nDisinflation: Cooling inflation has \\\"defined\\\" the current bull market, the firm wrote. While progress in lowering inflation seemed to stall in the early half of the year, prices have continued to trend closer to the Fed's 2% inflation target, clocking in at 2.5% in August. Avoiding a recession: The US needs a soft-landing for stocks to continue to do well. Recession risks, though, look \\\"low over the near-term,\\\" strategists said, with GDP clocking in at a robust 3% the last quarter. Strong earnings: Corporate earnings growth needs to be solid for markets to continue their uptrend. Earnings growth among S&P 500 firms was estimated to be around 4.6% over the third quarter, according to FactSet. If that proves to be true, that will mark the fifth straight quarter of earnings growth, the analytics firm said in a note.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\\"We remain bullish on US stocks on an absolute basis and relative to bonds and cash,\\\" strategists added.\"\n",

There are many different types of mortgages you can get, and all come with their own typical rates. A few of the most popular types include:\\n\\n30-year mortgage rates: The most popular type of mortgage, this fixed-rate home loan makes for low monthly payments by spreading the amount over 30 years. Because the rate is fixed, your interest rate won't change over the life of the loan. But 30-year mortgages have higher average rates compared to loans with shorter terms.\\n\\nThe most popular type of mortgage, this fixed-rate home loan makes for low monthly payments by spreading the amount over 30 years.

It has higher monthly payments since payments are spread over a shorter period of time.

ARM rates: Adjustable-rate mortgages, or ARMs, start with a fixed rate for a period of time. After that, your rate can change once or twice a year. ARM rates are sometimes lower than fixed rates initially, but be aware that your rate, and thus your monthly payment, can go up over time as the rate adjusts.\\n\\nAdjustable-rate mortgages, or ARMs, start with a fixed rate for a period of time. After that, your rate can change once or twice a year. ARM rates are sometimes lower than fixed rates initially, but be aware that your rate, and thus your monthly payment, can go up over time as the rate adjusts. FHA interest rates: Because FHA loans are a type of government-backed mortgage, their rates are typically lower than regular mortgage rates, making them more affordable for many borrowers. They also allow down payments of just 3.5%. But you'll need to pay FHA mortgage insurance for the life of the loan, which can be expensive compared to private mortgage insurance.\\n\\nBecause FHA loans are a type of government-backed mortgage, their rates are typically lower than regular mortgage rates, making them more affordable for many borrowers.

VA mortgage rates: This is also a type of government-backed mortgage. VA interest rates are often as low as or lower than FHA rates. VA loans also require no down payment and no mortgage insurance. But you'll need to be a military member or veteran to be eligible for one.\\n\\nThis is also a type of government-backed mortgage. VA interest rates are often as low as or lower than FHA rates. VA loans also require no down payment and no mortgage insurance. But you'll need to be a military member or veteran to be eligible for one. Jumbo mortgage rates: If you need a mortgage that exceeds the conforming loan limit ($766,550 in 2024), you'll have to get a jumbo loan. Jumbo mortgage rates vary by lender, but they may be comparable to conforming loan rates.\\n\\nMortgage refinance\\n\\nMortgage refinance rates typically differ somewhat from purchase rates, and may be slightly higher \\u2014 particularly if you're getting a cash-out refinance, since these are considered riskier.\\n\\nIf you're considering a refinance, be sure to shop around with the best mortgage refinance lenders and get multiple rate quotes to be sure you're getting the best deal.\\n\\n30-year mortgage refinance rates: Refinancing into a 30-year term can lower your monthly payment since you're spreading out what you owe over a longer period of time. But you'll pay more in interest over the life of the loan.\\n\\nRefinancing into a 30-year term can lower your monthly payment since you're spreading out what you owe over a longer period of time. But you'll pay more in interest over the life of the loan. 15-year mortgage refinance rates: Refinancing into a shorter term like a 15-year mortgage will increase your monthly payment, but help you save on interest.\\n\\nYou can refinance into the same type of mortgage you have or a different type. For example, you can refinance from an ARM to another ARM, though many borrowers opt to refinance from an ARM to a fixed-rate mortgage when rates are down so they can lock in a low rate.\\n\\nRefinancing from a government-backed mortgage into that same type of mortgage is called a streamline refinance. These come with a simpler process and don't require an appraisal.\\n\\nHome equity line of credit (HELOC) and home equity loans\\n\\nHELOC rates and home equity loan rates are generally a little higher than rates on first mortgages, but they can still be worth it if you're looking to tap into your home's equity without having to take on a new rate on your main mortgage.\\n\\nAs with other types of mortgages, you'll want to shop around and get multiple rate quotes to find the best HELOC lenders or home equity loan lenders.\\n\\nAverage mortgage rate by credit score\\n\\nData from credit scoring company FICO shows that the lower your credit score, the more you'll pay in mortgage interest. Here's the average interest rate by credit level for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage of $300,000, as of October 2024:\\n\\nFICO Score National average mortgage APR 620 to 639 6.575% 640 to 659 6.566% 660 to 679 6.563% 680 to 699 6.560% 700 to 759 6.555% 760 to 850 6.547%\\n\\nAccording to FICO, only people with credit scores above 660 will truly see interest rates around the national average.\\n\\nMortgage rate outlook\\n\\nInflation has slowed significantly in the last couple of years, and the Federal Reserve recently started cutting rates. This has helped mortgage rates fall in recent months, and they're expected to go down further next year.\\n\\nExpert forecasts and potential rate changes\\n\\nExpert forecasts are generally predicting that mortgage rates will hold steady for the rest of 2024 and go down a bit in 2025. Fannie Mae's latest forecast, for example, sees mortgage rates ending this year at 6.20% and falling to 5.70% by the end of 2025. The Mortgage Bankers Association's outlook is similar, though it thinks rates will end 2025 at 5.80%.\\n\\nUltimately, how much rates fall depends on the Fed and how the economy evolves in the coming months and years.\\n\\nCurrent mortgage rates' impact on home prices and inventory\\n\\nHigh mortgage rates have kept home prices from rising too rapidly this year, and the pace of increases may slow next year. In August 2024, the median sales price for existing homes was $416,700, according to the National Association of Realtors.\\n\\nThe MBA predicts that home prices will be up 3.9% by the end of 2024 and 2.7% in 2025. Fannie Mae says they could end this year up 6.1% and increase 3% in 2025.\\n\\nFalling mortgage rates often increase demand and put upward pressure on home prices. But as rates go down, homeowners who have been waiting for lower rates may be more willing to list their homes, increasing inventory. This should help prices from rising too quickly.\\n\\nImpact of home interest rates on homebuyers and homeowners\\n\\nHow rates affect affordability and buying power\\n\\nYour rate has a direct impact on how much house you can afford. Snagging a lower rate can enable you to borrow more money, boosting your homebuying power.\\n\\nFor example, say you can afford to spend $2,000 per month on your mortgage payment (not including taxes and insurance). With a rate of 7%, you could borrow around $300,000. But with a 4% rate, you could afford to borrow as much as $400,000.\\n\\nStrategies for buying in varying rate environments\\n\\nIf you're buying when rates are high, you'll need to adjust your homebuying plans accordingly. You might need to lower your price range or make a larger down payment to achieve an affordable monthly payment.\\n\\nYou should also be careful about overspending in a low rate environment. Though you may be able to borrow a larger amount with a low rate, make sure you aren't stretching your budget too far. You don't necessarily need to borrow the full amount the mortgage lender approves you for.\\n\\nAbility to refinance\\n\\nHow current mortgage rates are trending doesn't only impact people thinking about buying. If you own your home and pay a mortgage, you might want to see if you can save money by refinancing.\\n\\nDeciding when to refinance your mortgage depends on both current rate trends and your own goals.\\n\\nIf mortgage rates today are lower than the rate on your mortgage, you could lower your monthly payment by refinancing. But refinancing costs money, so you'll want to make sure your monthly savings make it worthwhile.\\n\\nYou can also refinance to take cash out of your home. This can be beneficial if you need to pay for a big home repair or upgrade. But if it means taking on a higher interest rate, it might not be worth it.\\n\\nHow are mortgage rates determined?\\n\\nMultiple factors affect the interest rate you'll pay on a mortgage. Some are outside of your control. Others you can influence.\\n\\nIndividual factors influencing mortgage rates\\n\\nKey determining factors that you do have control over include:\\n\\nYour credit score Debt-to-income ratio The amount of your down payment The type of mortgage you get The length of your term\\n\\nThe better your finances, the better the rate you'll get. But remember that rates can also vary a lot depending on the type of mortgage you get. FHA rates are typically lower than conventional rates, for example. Or an ARM rate might be lower initially than a fixed rate, but you won't have the security of knowing your rate won't change over the years.\\n\\nRates also vary by lender, so be sure to comparison shop to ensure you get the best rate available (more on that further down).\\n\\nRole of the economy and government policies\\n\\nNo matter how good your finances are, you won't be able to get a rate that's dramatically lower than average. Rates are determined in large part by economic trends and how those trends affect investor demand for mortgage-backed securities. Geopolitical trends or uncertainties can also cause mortgage rates to swing up or down.\\n\\nWhen there's a lot of economic growth, mortgage rates typically go up. In recent years, high inflation has pushed mortgage rates up. When growth is slower, rates often go down.\\n\\nFederal Reserve policy can influence mortgage rates. When the Fed raises or lowers the federal funds rate, mortgage rates can move up or down as well based on how investors believe Fed changes will impact the broader economy.\\n\\nLately, mortgage rates have been very sensitive to inflation and labor market data. As this economic data has shifted market expectations around Fed rate cuts, mortgage rates have fluctuated.\\n\\nHow to get the best mortgage rate\\n\\nCompare mortgage rates\\n\\nOne of the best ways to score a good rate is to get approved with at least two or three different lenders and compare the rates they offer you. Rates can vary a lot by lender, and some mortgage lenders may be significantly more affordable than others.\\n\\nUse a mortgage calculator to see how different rates can impact your monthly payment. For example, on a $400,000 loan, a 6.70% rate results in a monthly payment of $2,581, while a 6.30% rate results in a monthly payment of $2,476 \\u2014 a more than $100 difference.\\n\\nLocking in the best rate\\n\\nOnce you've been approved for a mortgage, your lender may give you the option to lock in your rate. Since rates fluctuate every day, a rate lock ensures you keep your current rate and avoid increases before you close on your loan. However, if rates decrease after you lock your rate, you won't be able to take advantage of it unless your lender offers a float down option.\\n\\nYour loan officer can help you figure out when a good time to lock in your rate might be. Rate locks typically last between 30 and 90 days.\\n\\nBuying down your rate\\n\\nYou can also get a better rate by paying for one. By purchasing mortgage points (also called discount points), you'll lower your interest rate by a certain amount. A mortgage point costs 1% of the loan amount and lowers your rate by 0.25 percentage points.\\n\\nYou can also get a temporary buydown to lower your rate for a period of time. For example, a 2-1 buydown lowers your rate by two percentage points for the first year you have the loan, then by one percentage point for the second year. After that, the rate returns to normal.\\n\\nThe importance of credit scores and down payments\\n\\nYour credit score and down payment can greatly affect the price you'll pay to borrow a mortgage.\\n\\nThe higher your score is, the less you'll pay to borrow money. Generally, 620 is the minimum credit score needed to buy a house, with some exceptions for government-backed loans. You'll also need to make a down payment. Conventional loans require a minimum of 3% down, but putting down more can unlock a better rate.\\n\\nIf you're having trouble getting a good rate, you might want to work on improving your credit or saving for a larger down payment and reapply later.\\n\\nConsider fees and beneficial features\\n\\nYour interest rate is one of the most important things to consider when shopping for lenders, but it's not the only factor you should be looking at. You'll also pay fees to get a mortgage, and some lenders charge more than others.\\n\\nWhen you apply for a mortgage, you'll get a loan estimate that allows you to see the expected costs with a given lender. You can also look at the loan's APR, which factors in both your interest rate and the lender's fees.\\n\\nYou should consider whether a lender has features that you find beneficial as well. Some lenders offer more flexibility for borrowers with lower credit scores or no credit history. Others may be a good option for first-time homebuyers, offering down payment assistance or affordable mortgage programs for these types of buyers.\\n\\nCurrent mortgage rates FAQs\\n\\nWhat factors contribute to average mortgage rates?

Tim Walz of Minnesota met on Tuesday night for the first and only vice-presidential debate.\\n\\nIt was the third general election debate of the 2024 campaign, following the June 27 debate that eventually led President Joe Biden to drop out of the race and the September debate between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump.\\n\\nIt's likely to be the last of the 2024 campaign. Trump has refused to debate Harris again.\\n\\nTuesday night's face-off represented an opportunity for both Walz and Vance to introduce themselves to their biggest audience yet while reinforcing their respective running mates' campaign messages.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nHere were some of the biggest moments of the debate.\\n\\nVance appeared more polished than Walz out of the gate\\n\\nThe first question of the debate was about the Middle East in light of an Iranian missile attack on Israel earlier on Tuesday. Both men were asked whether they would support a preemptive Israeli strike on Iran.\\n\\nWalz appeared to stumble over his words at first as he affirmed Democrats' standard line on Israel \\u2014 that they support the Jewish state's right to defend itself while acknowledging the humanitarian suffering in Gaza.\\n\\nAt one point, the Minnesota governor declared that the \\\"expansion of Israel and its proxies is an absolute fundamental necessity for the United States,\\\" seemingly confusing Israel with Iran, a country whose proxies include Hamas and Hezbollah.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nWalz then pivoted to attacking Trump, saying that \\\"a nearly 80-year-old Donald Trump talking about crowd sizes is not what we need in this moment.\\\" He did not directly address the question about an Israeli strike.\\n\\nYIKES from Walz to start #VPDebate: \\\"Iran [sic] -- or, uh, Israel's ability to be able to defend itself is absolutely fundamental, getting its hostages back, fundamental and ending the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, but the expansion of Israel [sic] and its proxies is an absolute\\u2026 pic.twitter.com/TZsI1jPjtK \\u2014 Curtis Houck (@CurtisHouck) October 2, 2024\\n\\nVance, on the other hand, started with his biography. \\\"I recognize a lot of Americans don't know who either one of us are,\\\" he said, recounting the life story that he first detailed in his memoir \\\"Hillbilly Elegy.\\\"\\n\\nThe Ohio senator later addressed the question by saying that he would support an Israeli strike if that's what Israel decided to do, saying the country should do \\\"what they think they need to do to keep their country safe.\\\" He also argued that Trump kept the world safe by \\\"establishing effective deterrence\\\" and that \\\"people were afraid of stepping out of line.\\\"\\n\\nWalz and Vance clash over climate change\\n\\nBoth Walz and Vance acknowledged the devastating effects of Hurricane Helene, which caused catastrophic flooding throughout parts of the Southeast.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nHowever, the two men then diverged sharply on climate change, which Democrats have championed as a defining issue of our time, while many GOP lawmakers have generally dismissed the science behind climate change or said the threats have been overstated.\\n\\nAt first, Vance's message appeared to acknowledge climate change.\\n\\n\\\"A lot of people are justifiably worried about all these crazy weather patterns,\\\" he said. \\\"I think it's important for us, first of all, to say Donald Trump and I support clean air, clean water. We want the environment to be cleaner and safer.\\\"\\n\\nBut then the Ohioan questioned whether carbon emissions are the main driver of climate change. He then remarked that the US needed to produce more energy within its borders.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nWalz responded by praising the Inflation Reduction Act \\u2014 which made big clean-energy investments \\u2014 and hammered the Trump-Vance ticket over what he said was their record on the climate.\\n\\n\\\"My farmers know climate change is real,\\\" Walz said, tying the issue to his experience as a Midwestern governor. \\\"They've seen 500-year droughts, 500-year floods \\u2014 back-to-back.\\\"\\n\\nWalz then sought to elevate the Biden-Harris record on energy production.\\n\\n\\\"We are producing more natural gas and more oil at any time than we ever have,\\\" the governor said. \\\"We're also producing more clean energy. So the solution for us is to continue to move forward. That climate change is real.\\\"\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nVance largely dodged on immigration \\u2014 and eventually, mics were cut\\n\\nIn a portion of the debate about immigration policy, Vance was asked to be more specific about Trump's plan for mass deportations \\u2014 specifically whether his administration would separate families in the case where parents entered the country illegally but the children are citizens.\\n\\nRelated stories\\n\\nHe largely avoided and deflected on the question. \\\"We already have massive child separations thanks to Kamala Harris' open border,\\\" Vance said, pointing to what he said were instances of possible sex trafficking.\\n\\nVance also largely dodged a question about Congress' role in immigration policy as Walz argued for the merits of a bipartisan immigration bill that Trump and Republicans moved to tank earlier this year.\\n\\n\\\"Most of this is about the president and the vice president empowering our law enforcement to say, 'If you try to come across the border illegally, you've got to stay in Mexico,'\\\" Vance said.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nEventually, the Ohio town of Springfield came up \\u2014 and things got testy when the moderators noted that the bulk of the Haitian migrants in the city are in the country legally.\\n\\nThat led Vance to begin arguing with the moderators. As he started describing the asylum process, the moderators cut him off, eventually cutting both his and Walz's microphones.\\n\\nWOW -- Vance gets mad when his lies about his own constituents are fact-checked. His mic ends up getting cut. pic.twitter.com/PxZ4nmphNW \\u2014 Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) October 2, 2024\\n\\nA discussion about the economy turned into a debate over the wisdom of experts\\n\\nWhen asked about their economic plans, each candidate made their standard pitch. Walz touted Harris' \\\"opportunity economy\\\" policies, including an expanded child tax credit and encouraging more housing construction.\\n\\nVance argued that voters should consider the state of the economy under Trump, which he said was largely strong until the pandemic. He then argued against the experts who've said Trump's plan would increase the deficit.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\\"They have Ph.D.s, but they don't have common sense, and they don't have wisdom,\\\" Vance said.\\n\\nThat led Walz to appeal to the power of experts. \\\"My pro tip of the day is this: If you need heart surgery, listen to the people at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota \\u2014 not Donald Trump.\\\"\\n\\nVance then retorted, claiming that experts \\\"lied\\\" about the impact of offshoring US manufacturing.\\n\\n\\\"Governor, you say trust the experts,\\\" Vance said. \\\"But those same experts, for 40 years, said that if we shipped our manufacturing base off to China, we'd get cheaper goods. They lied about that.\\\"\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nWalz was pressed about his Tiananmen Square claims\\n\\nWalz has previously claimed to have been in Hong Kong both before and during the 1989 Tiananmen Square Massacre, according to CNN, despite contemporaneous newspaper reports indicating that he did not travel to the territory until after the massacre. Walz made those claims in a 2019 radio interview and during a 2014 congressional hearing.\\n\\nThe Minnesota governor was pressed about that discrepancy during the debate and largely turned to his biography.\\n\\n\\\"I have poured my heart into my community. I've tried to do the best I can, but I've not been perfect, and I'm a knucklehead at times,\\\" Walz said. \\\"Many times, I will talk a lot, and I will get caught up in the rhetoric.\\\"\\n\\nWhen pressed further, he said: \\\"I got there that summer and misspoke on this, so I will just say that's what I've said. I was in Hong Kong and China during the democracy protests.\\\"\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nGov. Tim Walz says he \\\"misspoke\\\" when he claimed that he was in Hong Kong during the Tiananmen Square protests in the spring of 1989. As #VPdebate moderator @margbrennan points out, reports show he didn't travel to Asia until August of that year. pic.twitter.com/IpXc26KOBx \\u2014 CBS News (@CBSNews) October 2, 2024\\n\\nVance explained his shift toward a 'states' rights' abortion position\\n\\nThe Ohio senator was pressed about his shift from supporting federal restrictions on abortion to the \\\"states' rights\\\" approach favored by his running mate, Donald Trump.\\n\\nVance pointed specifically to the results of a 2023 referendum in Ohio in which the Buckeye State voted to enshrine abortion rights into the state constitution. \\\"The people of Ohio voted overwhelmingly, by the way, against my position,\\\" he said.\\n\\nVance said, as he has before, that Republicans have \\\"got to do a better job at winning back people's trust\\\" on the issues.\\n\\n\\\"So many young women would love to have families,\\\" Vance said. \\\"So many young women also see an unplanned pregnancy as something that's going to destroy their livelihood, destroy their education, destroy their relationships, and we have got to earn people's trust back.\\\"\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThe two VP candidates shared a moment of comity over gun violence\\n\\nIn a debate that was already strikingly collegial, the two candidates shared a rare moment of empathy over gun violence.\\n\\nRelated stories\\n\\nIt came after Walz mentioned that his 17-year-old son, Gus, witnessed a shooting in a community center while playing volleyball.\\n\\n\\\"First of all, I didn't know that your 17-year-old witnessed a shooting. I'm sorry about that,\\\" Vance said when it was his turn to speak. \\\"Christ have mercy.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Tim, first of all, I didn't know that your 17-year-old witnessed a shooting. And I'm sorry about that. Christ have mercy.\\\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u2014 JD Vance reacts to Tim Walz sharing that his son witnessed a shooting at a community center pic.twitter.com/Jgrl2tauQY \\u2014 The Recount (@therecount) October 2, 2024\\n\\nThe two otherwise stuck to their respective partisan positions on gun violence, with Walz arguing for gun-control laws as Vance promoted school security measures.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\\"We have to make the doors lock better. We have to make doors stronger. We've got to make the windows stronger,\\\" Vance said. \\\"The idea that we can magically wave a wand and take guns out of the hands of bad guys, it just doesn't fit with recent experience.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Do you want your schools hardened to look like a fort?\\\" Walz later said.\\n\\nWalz made a personal pitch on housing, while Vance emphasized energy production\\n\\nOne of the biggest issues facing voters is the shortage of affordable housing. And in many of the country's major metropolitan areas, some first-time homebuyers find themselves priced out of the communities where they grew up.\\n\\nWhen asked whether Harris's plans to provide $25,000 in down-payment grant assistance for first-time homebuyers would drive up home prices even more, Walz rejected the notion. And he made a personal appeal on the issue.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\\"The problem we've had is that we've got a lot of folks that see housing as another commodity,\\\" he said. \\\"It can be bought up, it can be shifted, it can be moved around. Those are not folks living in those houses.\\\"\\n\\nVance leaned into a message of expanding energy production \\u2014 which he said would lower costs overall \\u2014 while also criticizing the Biden-Harris administration.\\n\\n\\\"We don't want to blame immigrants for higher housing prices, but we do want to blame Kamala Harris for letting in millions of illegal aliens into this country, which does drive up costs,\\\" he said.\\n\\n\\\"If we open up American energy, you will get immediate pricing release relief for American citizens, not by the way, just in housing, but in a whole host of other economic goods, too,\\\" he added.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nWalz and Vance largely agreed on family policy \\u2014 but hit each other over the details\\n\\nBut the Ohio senator and Minnesota governor expressed empathy for parents who have to balance work and childcare and touted the benefits of an expansive child tax credit and more generous paid leave policy.\\n\\n\\\"I had to go back to work five days after my kids were born,\\\" Walz said, saying the paid medical leave he signed in Minnesota \\\"allows you to stay home.\\\"\\n\\nVance recounted the challenges faced by his own wife, Usha. \\\"Being a working mom, even for somebody with all of the advantages of my wife, is extraordinarily difficult,\\\" he said.\\n\\nHowever, they disagreed on how those sorts of programs would be funded. Vance argued that Trump's economic policies \\u2014 particularly tariffs \\u2014 would help bring in the revenue to fund those projects. Walz disagreed.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\\"Not only do they not get the money to pay for that, they're $4,000 in the hole,\\\" Walz said of what he contended households would pay in higher costs because of tariffs.\\n\\n'January 6 was not Facebook ads'\\n\\nOne of the most contentious points of the debate was over the Capitol riots on January 6, 2021. Vance sought to draw an equivalence between Trump's sweeping efforts to overturn the 2020 election and the prior Democratic protests of elections.\\n\\n\\\"Hillary Clinton in 2016 said that Donald Trump had the election stolen by Vladimir Putin because the Russians bought like $500,000 worth of Facebook ads,\\\" Vance said. \\\"This has been going on for a long time.\\\"\\n\\nWalz shot back: \\\"January 6 was not Facebook ads.\\\"\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nGov. Walz: January 6 was not Facebook ads. These things have massive repercussions. The idea that there is censorship to stop people from killing someone, that's not censorship.

It's not it's not anything anywhere other than in Donald Trump's world,\\\" Walz said. \\\"Look, when Mike Pence made that decision to certify that election, that's why Mike Pence isn't on this stage.\\\"\\n\\nClosing statements: Walz talked up Harris' big tent, Vance made the case for going back to Trump\\n\\nEach candidate used their two-minute closing statements to reiterate the message of their respective campaigns.\\n\\nWalz leaned heavily on Harris' pitch that she represents a passing of the torch and a chance to move beyond what he said were divisive politics.\\n\\n\\\"I'm as surprised as anybody of this coalition that Kamala Harris has built, from Bernie Sanders to Dick Cheney to Taylor Swift, and a whole bunch of folks in between them,\\\" Walz said. \\\"They don't all agree on everything, but they are truly optimistic people.\\\"\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nVance argued that life had become unaffordable for many Americans since Biden took office and asked voters to remember what he said was the state of the economy under Trump.\\n\\n\\\"We need change. We need a new direction,\\\" Vance said. \\\"We need a president who has already done this once before and did it well.\\\"\"\n",

This week's service index is also worth monitoring, she said.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nTo her point, the LEI gauge has persistently signaled headwinds ahead. Between February and August, it dropped 2.3%. According to the Conference Board, the decline in the six-month growth rate was enough to trigger a recession in August.\\n\\nMeanwhile, manufacturing can't seem to break out of its downturn. This week, September's Manufacturing PMI print remained stuck at 47.2 \\u2014 any reading below 50 signals a contraction. This has been the case for six consecutive months and for 22 out of the past 23 months.\\n\\n\\\"Demand remains subdued, as companies showed an unwillingness to invest in capital and inventory due to federal monetary policy \\u2014 which the US Federal Reserve addressed by the time of this report \\u2014 and election uncertainty,\\\" Tim Fiore, chair of the ISM manufacturing business survey committee, said in a report.\\n\\nStill, these data prints have taken a backseat to labor data, which holds the spotlight on Wall Street.

      "            \"text\": \"Vice President Kamala Harris has touted a new economic plan to drive \\u201cbroad-based economic growth,\\u201d but her policies contradict this message. Her narrowly targeted America Forward tax credit for \\u201cindustries of the future\\u201d and tax hikes for the rest would reshape investment yet fail to stimulate more investment overall\\u2014much like former President Donald Trump\\u2019s protectionist proposals for a universal tariff and higher tariffs on China that would reallocate, but not grow, economic activity.\\n\\nTax policies, whether rates, deductions for initial investment costs, or credits for investment and production, can change the cost of capital. A higher cost of capital leads to less capital investment, while a lower cost of capital leads to more capital investment.\\n\\nUnlike industry-specific policies, which (mostly) reallocate investment from one sector to another, broad policies that lower the cost of capital across the entire economy can lead to more overall investment across the board.\\n\\nUnfortunately, Harris has not outlined a broad pro-investment vision. The suite of policies she\\u2019s crafted include higher taxes on business income across the board, with top rates of 28% on corporate firms and 39.6% on non-corporates, and narrowly targeted tax breaks for certain industries or technologies. It\\u2019s not hard to see that the resulting policy environment would be generally less favorable to investment\\u2014unless one is lucky enough to be on the receiving end of the new subsidies.\\n\\nIn fact, we\\u2019ve estimated at the Tax Foundation that the net effect of Harris\\u2019s previously announced tax policies would be to shrink the size of the economy by 1.7% and the capital stock by 2.6% within a decade (2% and 3%, respectively, in our 35-year projection). Investment tax credits may lower the cost of capital in some sectors\\u2014but they won\\u2019t offset the broad negative impact of higher taxes on the overall economy. Altogether, we estimate Harris\\u2019s tax and spending policies could increase the 10-year budget deficit by about $1.5 trillion.\\n\\nWorse, targeted subsidies themselves may prove to be counterproductive, as they risk creating boondoggles and misallocations by favoring certain sectors over others. A review of 50 years of targeted policies in the United States conducted by the Peterson Institute concluded that \\u201cthe track record of such efforts has achieved mixed success at best.\\u201d Import protection and single-firm subsidies have seldom paid off in the past, and there\\u2019s little reason to believe that will change under the next U.S. president.\\n\\nIndeed, while the industrial policies pursued by the Biden administration\\u2014namely tax credits for green energy and semiconductors\\u2014have seemingly led to a boom in construction spending in the subsidized industries, aggregate investment spending is little changed compared to pre-policy baselines. Whether the higher construction spending in subsidized industries yields higher overall growth for worker productivity or the U.S. economy remains to be seen, but there are plenty of reasons for skepticism.\\n\\nJust as Harris\\u2019s combination of higher taxes for all and selective subsidies for a few doesn\\u2019t add up to broad-based economic growth, Trump\\u2019s proposed tariffs would reallocate investment across sectors by changing relative prices and ultimately hurt growth.\\n\\nWhile Trump has championed some pro-growth tax reforms\\u2014like full expensing for investments in machinery, equipment, and R&D\\u2014his protectionist tariffs and the resulting retaliation from trade partners would undermine those gains. And in terms of domestic tax reform, he has been more focused on targeted tax breaks for specific types of income, such as tips, overtime pay, or Social Security benefits. We estimate the plan so far, excluding Trump\\u2019s new overtime tax proposal, would shrink the size of the economy by 0.2% within a decade.\\n\\nWe don\\u2019t have to look far to see the track record of protectionist tariffs. The 2018-2019 trade war tariffs imposed by then-President Trump, combined with retaliation from foreign trading partners, depressed investment growth, reduced overall employment, and shrunk real incomes. Though tariffs certainly create benefits for protected industries, those benefits represent costly transfers from others in the economy. Altogether, Trump\\u2019s tax and tariff policy proposals could increase the 10-year budget deficit by nearly $3.8 trillion.\\n\\nBoth candidates\\u2019 policies would ultimately stifle the kinds of broad economic expansion they claim to seek. To achieve broad sustained growth, the next president should pursue tax policies that lower the cost of capital across all industries, rather than reshape investment through subsidies or other forms of protection. Unfortunately, Harris and Trump are making the same mistake in trying to reshape investment and redistribute income and economic activity to their favored sectors.\\n\\nMore must-read commentary published by Fortune:\\n\\nThe opinions expressed in Fortune.com commentary pieces are solely the views of their authors and do not necessarily reflect the opinions and beliefs of Fortune.\"\n",

There are many different types of mortgages you can get, and all come with their own typical rates. A few of the most popular types include:\\n\\n30-year mortgage rates: The most popular type of mortgage, this fixed-rate home loan makes for low monthly payments by spreading the amount over 30 years. Because the rate is fixed, your interest rate won't change over the life of the loan. But 30-year mortgages have higher average rates compared to loans with shorter terms.\\n\\nThe most popular type of mortgage, this fixed-rate home loan makes for low monthly payments by spreading the amount over 30 years.

ARM rates: Adjustable-rate mortgages, or ARMs, start with a fixed rate for a period of time. After that, your rate can change once or twice a year. ARM rates are sometimes lower than fixed rates initially, but be aware that your rate, and thus your monthly payment, can go up over time as the rate adjusts.\\n\\nAdjustable-rate mortgages, or ARMs, start with a fixed rate for a period of time. After that, your rate can change once or twice a year. ARM rates are sometimes lower than fixed rates initially, but be aware that your rate, and thus your monthly payment, can go up over time as the rate adjusts. FHA interest rates: Because FHA loans are a type of government-backed mortgage, their rates are typically lower than regular mortgage rates, making them more affordable for many borrowers. They also allow down payments of just 3.5%. But you'll need to pay FHA mortgage insurance for the life of the loan, which can be expensive compared to private mortgage insurance.\\n\\nBecause FHA loans are a type of government-backed mortgage, their rates are typically lower than regular mortgage rates, making them more affordable for many borrowers.

VA mortgage rates: This is also a type of government-backed mortgage. VA interest rates are often as low as or lower than FHA rates. VA loans also require no down payment and no mortgage insurance. But you'll need to be a military member or veteran to be eligible for one.\\n\\nThis is also a type of government-backed mortgage. VA interest rates are often as low as or lower than FHA rates. VA loans also require no down payment and no mortgage insurance. But you'll need to be a military member or veteran to be eligible for one. Jumbo mortgage rates: If you need a mortgage that exceeds the conforming loan limit ($766,550 in 2024), you'll have to get a jumbo loan. Jumbo mortgage rates vary by lender, but they may be comparable to conforming loan rates.\\n\\nMortgage refinance\\n\\nMortgage refinance rates typically differ somewhat from purchase rates, and may be slightly higher \\u2014 particularly if you're getting a cash-out refinance, since these are considered riskier.\\n\\nIf you're considering a refinance, be sure to shop around with the best mortgage refinance lenders and get multiple rate quotes to be sure you're getting the best deal.\\n\\n30-year mortgage refinance rates: Refinancing into a 30-year term can lower your monthly payment since you're spreading out what you owe over a longer period of time. But you'll pay more in interest over the life of the loan.\\n\\nRefinancing into a 30-year term can lower your monthly payment since you're spreading out what you owe over a longer period of time. But you'll pay more in interest over the life of the loan. 15-year mortgage refinance rates: Refinancing into a shorter term like a 15-year mortgage will increase your monthly payment, but help you save on interest.\\n\\nYou can refinance into the same type of mortgage you have or a different type. For example, you can refinance from an ARM to another ARM, though many borrowers opt to refinance from an ARM to a fixed-rate mortgage when rates are down so they can lock in a low rate.\\n\\nRefinancing from a government-backed mortgage into that same type of mortgage is called a streamline refinance. These come with a simpler process and don't require an appraisal.\\n\\nHome equity line of credit (HELOC) and home equity loans\\n\\nHELOC rates and home equity loan rates are generally a little higher than rates on first mortgages, but they can still be worth it if you're looking to tap into your home's equity without having to take on a new rate on your main mortgage.\\n\\nAs with other types of mortgages, you'll want to shop around and get multiple rate quotes to find the best HELOC lenders or home equity loan lenders.\\n\\nAverage mortgage rate by credit score\\n\\nData from credit scoring company FICO shows that the lower your credit score, the more you'll pay in mortgage interest. Here's the average interest rate by credit level for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage of $300,000, as of October 2024:\\n\\nFICO Score National average mortgage APR 620 to 639 6.575% 640 to 659 6.566% 660 to 679 6.563% 680 to 699 6.560% 700 to 759 6.555% 760 to 850 6.547%\\n\\nAccording to FICO, only people with credit scores above 660 will truly see interest rates around the national average.\\n\\nMortgage rate outlook\\n\\nInflation has slowed significantly in the last couple of years, and the Federal Reserve recently started cutting rates. This has helped mortgage rates fall in recent months, and they're expected to go down further next year.\\n\\nExpert forecasts and potential rate changes\\n\\nExpert forecasts are generally predicting that mortgage rates will hold steady for the rest of 2024 and go down a bit in 2025. Fannie Mae's latest forecast, for example, sees mortgage rates ending this year at 6.20% and falling to 5.70% by the end of 2025. The Mortgage Bankers Association's outlook is similar, though it thinks rates will end 2025 at 5.80%.\\n\\nUltimately, how much rates fall depends on the Fed and how the economy evolves in the coming months and years.\\n\\nCurrent mortgage rates' impact on home prices and inventory\\n\\nHigh mortgage rates have kept home prices from rising too rapidly this year, and the pace of increases may slow next year. In August 2024, the median sales price for existing homes was $416,700, according to the National Association of Realtors.\\n\\nThe MBA predicts that home prices will be up 3.9% by the end of 2024 and 2.7% in 2025. Fannie Mae says they could end this year up 6.1% and increase 3% in 2025.\\n\\nFalling mortgage rates often increase demand and put upward pressure on home prices. But as rates go down, homeowners who have been waiting for lower rates may be more willing to list their homes, increasing inventory. This should help prices from rising too quickly.\\n\\nImpact of home interest rates on homebuyers and homeowners\\n\\nHow rates affect affordability and buying power\\n\\nYour rate has a direct impact on how much house you can afford. Snagging a lower rate can enable you to borrow more money, boosting your homebuying power.\\n\\nFor example, say you can afford to spend $2,000 per month on your mortgage payment (not including taxes and insurance). With a rate of 7%, you could borrow around $300,000. But with a 4% rate, you could afford to borrow as much as $400,000.\\n\\nStrategies for buying in varying rate environments\\n\\nIf you're buying when rates are high, you'll need to adjust your homebuying plans accordingly. You might need to lower your price range or make a larger down payment to achieve an affordable monthly payment.\\n\\nYou should also be careful about overspending in a low rate environment. Though you may be able to borrow a larger amount with a low rate, make sure you aren't stretching your budget too far. You don't necessarily need to borrow the full amount the mortgage lender approves you for.\\n\\nAbility to refinance\\n\\nHow current mortgage rates are trending doesn't only impact people thinking about buying. If you own your home and pay a mortgage, you might want to see if you can save money by refinancing.\\n\\nDeciding when to refinance your mortgage depends on both current rate trends and your own goals.\\n\\nIf mortgage rates today are lower than the rate on your mortgage, you could lower your monthly payment by refinancing. But refinancing costs money, so you'll want to make sure your monthly savings make it worthwhile.\\n\\nYou can also refinance to take cash out of your home. This can be beneficial if you need to pay for a big home repair or upgrade. But if it means taking on a higher interest rate, it might not be worth it.\\n\\nHow are mortgage rates determined?\\n\\nMultiple factors affect the interest rate you'll pay on a mortgage. Some are outside of your control. Others you can influence.\\n\\nIndividual factors influencing mortgage rates\\n\\nKey determining factors that you do have control over include:\\n\\nYour credit score Debt-to-income ratio The amount of your down payment The type of mortgage you get The length of your term\\n\\nThe better your finances, the better the rate you'll get. But remember that rates can also vary a lot depending on the type of mortgage you get. FHA rates are typically lower than conventional rates, for example. Or an ARM rate might be lower initially than a fixed rate, but you won't have the security of knowing your rate won't change over the years.\\n\\nRates also vary by lender, so be sure to comparison shop to ensure you get the best rate available (more on that further down).\\n\\nRole of the economy and government policies\\n\\nNo matter how good your finances are, you won't be able to get a rate that's dramatically lower than average. Rates are determined in large part by economic trends and how those trends affect investor demand for mortgage-backed securities. Geopolitical trends or uncertainties can also cause mortgage rates to swing up or down.\\n\\nWhen there's a lot of economic growth, mortgage rates typically go up. In recent years, high inflation has pushed mortgage rates up. When growth is slower, rates often go down.\\n\\nFederal Reserve policy can influence mortgage rates. When the Fed raises or lowers the federal funds rate, mortgage rates can move up or down as well based on how investors believe Fed changes will impact the broader economy.\\n\\nLately, mortgage rates have been very sensitive to inflation and labor market data. As this economic data has shifted market expectations around Fed rate cuts, mortgage rates have fluctuated.\\n\\nHow to get the best mortgage rate\\n\\nCompare mortgage rates\\n\\nOne of the best ways to score a good rate is to get approved with at least two or three different lenders and compare the rates they offer you. Rates can vary a lot by lender, and some mortgage lenders may be significantly more affordable than others.\\n\\nUse a mortgage calculator to see how different rates can impact your monthly payment. For example, on a $400,000 loan, a 6.70% rate results in a monthly payment of $2,581, while a 6.30% rate results in a monthly payment of $2,476 \\u2014 a more than $100 difference.\\n\\nLocking in the best rate\\n\\nOnce you've been approved for a mortgage, your lender may give you the option to lock in your rate. Since rates fluctuate every day, a rate lock ensures you keep your current rate and avoid increases before you close on your loan. However, if rates decrease after you lock your rate, you won't be able to take advantage of it unless your lender offers a float down option.\\n\\nYour loan officer can help you figure out when a good time to lock in your rate might be. Rate locks typically last between 30 and 90 days.\\n\\nBuying down your rate\\n\\nYou can also get a better rate by paying for one. By purchasing mortgage points (also called discount points), you'll lower your interest rate by a certain amount. A mortgage point costs 1% of the loan amount and lowers your rate by 0.25 percentage points.\\n\\nYou can also get a temporary buydown to lower your rate for a period of time. For example, a 2-1 buydown lowers your rate by two percentage points for the first year you have the loan, then by one percentage point for the second year. After that, the rate returns to normal.\\n\\nThe importance of credit scores and down payments\\n\\nYour credit score and down payment can greatly affect the price you'll pay to borrow a mortgage.\\n\\nThe higher your score is, the less you'll pay to borrow money. Generally, 620 is the minimum credit score needed to buy a house, with some exceptions for government-backed loans. You'll also need to make a down payment. Conventional loans require a minimum of 3% down, but putting down more can unlock a better rate.\\n\\nIf you're having trouble getting a good rate, you might want to work on improving your credit or saving for a larger down payment and reapply later.\\n\\nConsider fees and beneficial features\\n\\nYour interest rate is one of the most important things to consider when shopping for lenders, but it's not the only factor you should be looking at. You'll also pay fees to get a mortgage, and some lenders charge more than others.\\n\\nWhen you apply for a mortgage, you'll get a loan estimate that allows you to see the expected costs with a given lender. You can also look at the loan's APR, which factors in both your interest rate and the lender's fees.\\n\\nYou should consider whether a lender has features that you find beneficial as well. Some lenders offer more flexibility for borrowers with lower credit scores or no credit history. Others may be a good option for first-time homebuyers, offering down payment assistance or affordable mortgage programs for these types of buyers.\\n\\nCurrent mortgage rates FAQs\\n\\nWhat factors contribute to average mortgage rates?

But when Oswald decided to launch a small business in the fall of 2022, the couple liquidated some of their assets to fund the company, throwing their financial planning to the wind.\\n\\nWith fewer than five weeks until Election Day, Vice President Kamala Harris is making a targeted pitch to entrepreneurs like Oswald, who are burdened by startup expenses. She even mentioned a key proposal in her opening answer at the presidential debate: expand the small business tax deduction 10-fold, from $5,000 to $50,000.\\n\\nIn a pamphlet on her economic plan, dubbed the \\\"Opportunity Economy,\\\" Harris explains that she would let business owners take advantage of the $50,000 tax deduction right away or a few years after launching, to help lower taxes once they start turning a profit. The proposal, like many of her others, would need congressional approval.\\n\\nOswald told Business Insider the deduction would have been \\\"invaluable\\\" in getting Brisa Systems, which offers powered drying racks, off the ground.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nHarris' proposal shifts the tax timeline for entrepreneurs.\\n\\nTax experts told BI that enacting the new deduction would mean a change in timing more than anything else. Under current law, small businesses can deduct up to $5,000 in expenses immediately and must deduct any future expenses against their income over 15 years. Harris' proposal would let entrepreneurs deduct more money quickly.\\n\\nOwners have expenses before even launching their business, and the deduction would help cover those costs.\\n\\nRhett Buttle, the co-executive director of Small Business Roundtable and a former business advisor for President Joe Biden, told Business Insider that startup costs accumulate in three primary areas: marketing, basic equipment, and hiring.\\n\\nFor Oswald, most early costs have been in manufacturing and intellectual property services. Taylor McCleneghan, who launched her product development company, Small Shop LLC, in 2018, named inventory and marketing as the biggest upfront costs. Both women are based in the Chicago area.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nHarris has made supporting small business a key part of her economic agenda. Danielle Parhizkaran/The Boston Globe via Getty Images\\n\\nBrett Theodos, a senior fellow at Urban Institute who specializes in small business loans, told BI that entrepreneurs would \\\"love\\\" to be able to deduct more of those expenses right away. Moving up the timeline would, he said, make many feel less strapped for cash from the very outset.\\n\\nRelated stories\\n\\nAnd there's another potential upside, according to Garret Watson, a senior policy analyst at the nonpartisan Tax Foundation. Small businesses would likely benefit from getting the deduction more quickly because of inflation, he said.\\n\\nMany entrepreneurs are psyched about the effort. Theodos struggled to think of a reason why they wouldn't want this, and Buttle said that those he works with are overwhelmingly excited about the plan.\\n\\nMcCleneghan, of the Small Shop, said having access to a $50,000 tax deduction early on would have allowed her to do better long-term planning. With the expanded tax deduction, Oswald said she might not have had to divest retirement funds or take out lines of credit.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\\"Getting money in the hands of entrepreneurs sooner is going to allow them to hire, to get equipment, to get a space, to pay off some debt, to pay themselves,\\\" Theodos said. \\\"So it's meaningful to allow them to accelerate the deduction of startup expenses.\\\"\\n\\nBut while small business owners may jump at the opportunity for more early cash flow, where this money would come from is more unclear. McCleneghan herself acknowledged that the details seem hazy.\\n\\nDespite the flashy numbers, the proposal likely wouldn't have a significant impact on the federal budget.\\n\\nThough $50,000 sounds like a big-ticket promise, the experts BI spoke to said Harris' proposal actually wouldn't make a big dent in the federal budget. The Tax Foundation, where Watson works, examined cost estimates from prior expansions and found that the proposal would cost about $24.5 billion over 10 years.\\n\\n\\\"Relative to the federal government's budget and spending, it's very small,\\\" Watson said. \\\"This $25 billion number is in the context of a tax plan for the Harris campaign that would raise about $5 trillion over 10 years. So you're talking about orders of magnitude more money on the tax hike side.\\\"\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nHarris' proposal would require congressional approval. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\\n\\nSome of the loss, he said, stems from the likelihood that certain entrepreneurs will use the deduction and then go out of business. Since the proposal changes when businesses can deduct rather than how much they deduct, it will cost some money, but not \\\"big money,\\\" Theodos said.\\n\\nAnd the proposal could help spur growth, if it becomes law. According to a study from the Pew Research Center published in April 2024, small businesses employ nearly half of the country's private sector employees.\\n\\nTheodos called small businesses \\\"essential\\\" for the US economy, and Buttle said they're a crucial source of innovation. But the tax experts said the full potential economic impact of the proposed expansion is still up in the air.\\n\\n\\\"The question is, will this significantly contribute to a startup boom or really change the needle there or move the needle there? I think that's a reasonable question. It's up for debate, particularly because this is such a narrow provision,\\\" Watson told BI, while noting that giving businesses deductions is generally a good policy.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nIf the policy did spur more development, though, Mary Hansen, an economics professor at American University and co-director of the nonpartisan Institute for Macroeconomic and Policy Analysis, said it would eventually have a net positive impact on government revenue.\\n\\nAs of now, Harris' promise is just that \\u2014 a promise.\\n\\nShould she win the election, Congress would need to pass legislation to turn her expanded tax deduction idea into a reality. Despite the prevailing congressional gridlock, all of the experts BI spoke with said small businesses are a rare point of potential bipartisan agreement. Watson predicted that lawmakers would likely tie the proposal to their actions on the expiring 2017 tax provisions.\\n\\nHarris' proposal would disproportionately impact entrepreneurs with less access to capital, namely women and people of color. Francine Orr / Los Angeles Times\\n\\nShould Congress ever pass the expanded tax deduction, all startups and small businesses would access the same amount of money \\u2014 but the experts told BI that some would feel the impact more than others. Entrepreneurs with less initial cash flow would disproportionately benefit from the change, they said.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nButtle said it would help women and people of color who have a harder time accessing capital. The Pew Research study found 61% of small businesses are majority-owned by men and, as of 2021, 85% were majority-white owned.\\n\\n\\\"We're talking about community businesses, micro-businesses, businesses where the founder doesn't have as much net worth,\\\" Theodos told BI. \\\"Everybody can benefit from $45,000, but the question is, who is that making the critical difference for?\\\"\"\n",

Having grown up in central North Carolina, Hoffman said he was used to hurricane season and didn't think Asheville would be too severely impacted. But after the campus lost power, water, and any contact with family members off campus, the scale of the hurricane began to set in.\\n\\nHoffman and his girlfriend Wahlers left campus on September 28 to stay at his home in Chapel Hill. Wahlers said that she waited in line at the gas station for three hours, and she realized that the card readers weren't working and she didn't have any cash, so a woman at the station filled up the tank for her.\\n\\nWhile Hoffman and Wahlers have received periodic communications from the university on the next steps, they didn't realize how disruptive the hurricane had been until they left campus.\\n\\n\\\"When we first got back, a lot of it is just figuring things out,\\\" Hoffman said. \\\"You don't realize how many things you think about once you've been displaced.\\\"\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAshley Wahlers and Asa Hoffman left UNC Asheville after Hurricane Helene hit the campus.

And with his job being based in Asheville, he'll have to turn to alternate routes to make money, including working for DoorDash.\\n\\nNelson also noted that the situation with her financial aid is uncertain. She's financing her education largely with student loans, and she's not sure how the class cancellations will impact her tuition payments.\\n\\nAmid the limbo period with their college educations, the damage in their communities is taking a toll. Wahler's hometown is in Yancey County, which has suffered severely from the hurricane, and she said that her \\\"town is destroyed.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It's so sad to see my parents' neighborhood completely destroyed, and a house got taken away at the bottom of the neighborhood.

The flooding and sirens came next, as Category 4 Hurricane Helene made its way up from the Gulf Coast.\\n\\nHelene's damage in western North Carolina has been catastrophic. Asheville and its surrounding small towns are almost completely flooded \\u2014 despite their location near the Blue Ridge mountains, about 300 miles inland. Residents and local businesses have been left without electricity, running water, cell service, and access to essentials.

Some of the couples who got engaged met at the dog-catered venue; others just love it so much that that's where they wanted to make things official.\\n\\nIt's not just romance brewing at the Dog Bar. Politicians come by to do some stumping (and, presumably, dog petting). Young professionals convene for meet-ups. And a good chunk of customers don't even have dogs; they just want to hang out amongst both friends human and furry.\\n\\nIt's all part of a new shift in American public and social life: It's gone to the dogs.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nVirtually all US pet owners now say their furry companions are part of their family \\u2014 up from 86% of dog owners and 78% of cat owners in 2006. This might be in part because many younger Americans are having kids later than previous generations, or not having them at all.\\n\\n\\\"People are really combining their social life with their dog ownership nowadays,\\\" Kendal Kulp, the co-founder and CEO of Wagbar, a dog park and bar in Asheville, North Carolina, that regularly hosts weddings, dog birthday bashes, and Halloween parties. The space is currently hosting hurricane relief efforts for the local community.\\n\\nIf you feel like you can't turn a corner without seeing a four-legged friend, you're not alone. America's younger workers are getting hooked on their dogs, and they're generating their own revenue streams \\u2014 and popping up everywhere, occasionally to some people's chagrin.\\n\\n\\\"The dog today is not the dog of 10 years ago,\\\" Bobby Boivin, the co-owner of Boo's Dog Bar in Sarasota, Florida, said. \\\"The dog today is literally a child in the family. It is a family member. And well, when people go out to dinner, they want to bring the whole family with them.\\\"\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nYou can feel that at the Dog Bar. Some of their community events are directly inspired by the other type of kids \\u2014 the human variety. Stephanie Marble, the events coordinator and membership director, said she's taken inspiration from the birthday parties she threw for her sons when they were little.\\n\\n\\\"One thing that we do that's really simple in Florida is we just put sprinklers out in the yard,\\\" Marble said, \\\"because in the summertime when you're trying to get the kids to do something, get out of the house and stop complaining, you just turn the sprinkler on and throw them all outside in the front yard and they can play for hours with their little pools and their little sprinklers. And so we do that once or twice a year at Dog Bar.\\\"\\n\\nShe offers party packages, Santa for holiday photos, and an Easter egg hunt for dogs. Santa Steve, in particular, is a big hit \\u2014 his photos with dogs frequently end up in their owner's digital Christmas cards. He has almost 200 sittings with dogs every year, broken up across two days.\\n\\nThe obsession with canines is shaping our built environments, from bars to apartments to your favorite coffee shop. Our urban infrastructure and lifestyles are increasingly designed around pet ownership. Call it the invasion of the dogs.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nEveryone got dogs\\n\\nIn Washington, DC, a single-story laundromat and parking lot just off Logan Circle is being transformed into a 6,000-square-foot \\\"dog-friendly garden\\\" called Dog Daze. The turf and tree-dotted venue will feature vendors serving coffee, beer, pizza, smoothies, and acai bowls. The idea is to create a place where both people and dogs want to be regulars.\\n\\nRelated stories\\n\\n\\\"You can go to a dog park, and you can sit down for a quick amount of time, but it's really more of a check-the-box activity versus actually somewhere you want to stay and hang out,\\\" said Dog Daze managing partner Kyle Cissel. \\\"We wanted to make sure that it was somewhere they felt at home, they're willing to spend time, and they would actually stay for longer periods of time and make it part of their daily, weekly, and monthly schedule.\\\"\\n\\nOver the last few decades, the percentage of households with kids has plummeted, while the share that owns a pet has ticked up. The percentage of homebuyers with a child under 18 living with them has fallen by nearly half since the 1980s, according to a NAR analysis of US Census data. At the same time, the share of households with pets has grown from 56% in 1988 to 66% today. And during the pandemic alone, over 23 million US households welcomed dogs into their homes.\\n\\n\\\"We see dogs all the time where people are like, 'Yeah, this is my covid baby. I never liked dogs before, but I got one, and now it's my favorite thing in the world,'\\\" said Kulp, of Wagbar.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThat dog boom coincided with a few other key trends: Americans were feeling lonely, they couldn't afford to sink more money into dating, and larger homes with yards were financially out of reach.\\n\\nNearly one in five homebuyers factor pets into their housing and neighborhood choice, according to data from the National Association of Realtors (NAR). That's up from 15% in 2018. Among unmarried couples, the number jumps to 29%. A third of those who consider their pets needs when choosing a home say they want to be close to parks and recreation, NAR found. Inside the home, features like dog and cat doors, outdoor \\\"catios\\\" for felines, and fenced yards are all in demand.\\n\\nIt pays for landlords and homebuilders to provide for their non-human customers. After all, the dog business is booming. Spending on US pet care alone has ballooned from $53.3 billion in 2012 to $147 billion in 2023. Americans are also increasingly spending more time on their fuzzy friends; in 2003, according to the American Time Use Survey, Americans ages 25 to 34 spent just over four minutes a day on average on animal and pet care (that includes Americans without pets). By 2023, it had risen to nine minutes a day.\\n\\nAnd while playgrounds have traditionally been a social hub for parents and kids alike, dog amenities offer a new kind of community or third place. That might explain why dog-centric bars and restaurants \\u2014 where dogs aren't just a patio feature but the main attraction \\u2014 are popping up all over the country.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nCissel thinks the future is bright for dog-friendly third spaces. He argued that a dog social club like Dog Daze is similar to a local gym or convenience store \\u2014 an amenity neighbors would use multiple times a week, as opposed to other leisure amenities like movie theaters. \\\"It's definitely something that I think you'll see in every neighborhood in the next 10 years,\\\" he said.\\n\\nTara Downs, the owner of the seven-year-old Pub Dog in Colorado, said that she's noticed some economic shifts from her customers \\u2014 three or four years ago, someone would come in and order a few beers and food for themselves, and food for their dogs. Now, they're seeing humans cut back on what they're spending on themselves but still getting their dogs the same treats.\\n\\n\\\"So they're still finding ways to make sure that they're giving their dogs everything that they want for them \\u2014 no matter what it means for them in the human sense,\\\" she said.\\n\\nTake Fred Metzler. He was working a corporate job selling automatic doors when he decided he wanted a change. After adopting two puppies, he fell in love with a dog bar in his neighborhood. He and his former business partner decided to bring that concept down to St. Petersburg, Florida and ended up opening the Dog Bar in 2016.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nMetzler also noticed something else over the last decade or so: \\\"The pet industry seemed to be kind of recession-proof. I mean, through '07, '08, when things were just terrible, and our business was way down in construction, companies like PetSmart never slowed down.\\\" Even in 2009, PetSmart's store sales growth slowed down to what the Wall Street Journal hailed as a \\\"respectable\\\" rate that rebounded and then some. After all, as Kulp, the co-founder and CEO of Wagbar, said: \\\"People spend more money on their dogs sometimes than themselves.\\\"\\n\\nAccording to a survey from the American Pet Products Association of 10,156 pet owners from December 2023 to January 2024, 27% of dog owners said that they hold holiday or birthday parties for their dogs \\u2014 up from just 14% in 2018.\\n\\nRelated stories\\n\\nIn some tangible ways, today's dog owners indeed see their pets as children. It does make sense: In a country where the cost of living is rising and raising a kid costs $26,000 a year, becoming a dog parent might feel more financially sound \\u2014 and still help stave off loneliness.\\n\\n\\\"People are lonely, people take dogs as serious as children,\\\" Luke Silverman, the CEO and co-founder of Bark Social, a social club for dogs and humans with locations across the country, told BI. \\\"All that together brings together these really unique opportunities to create a community.\\\"\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nWhat it means to have dogs everywhere\\n\\nStephanie Chez, 26, first noticed more dogs around when she spent the summer of 2021 working at IKEA. Since then, she's seen them everywhere, from Sephora to Target to coffee shops.\\n\\nChez loves dogs, but her fiance is allergic. Obviously, she said, some dogs are service animals and people with allergies will have to contend with that. And she enjoys seeing dogs around \\u2014 but she's still adjusting to the new normal.\\n\\n\\\"Sometimes it's like, oh, did you have to bring your dog into this tiny little coffee shop?\\\" she said.\\n\\nIt's a question that Americans might be reckoning with more, especially as society becomes more dog-centric. According to the APPA survey, 15% of dog owners are bringing their dogs with them in the car daily to run errands or go about their daily routines \\u2014 up from 10% in 2018. More dog owners are also bringing their dogs with them on vacation; around a third of them have brought their dogs on a two-plus night trip via car, and around a fifth did the same via plane.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nOther pet owners might be looking to do the same. Silverman said that someone once called and asked if they could bring a miniature horse in. His answer: If it was a service animal, yes. The horse ultimately never made an appearance.\\n\\nUnleashed Hounds and Hops in Minnesota has had one cat come in a backpack, according to founder Kevin Knutson. The cat mostly kept to itself; as long as it wasn't disrupting the dogs, it was okay for the not-dog to attend.\\n\\n\\\"It's the same thing with kids,\\\" Knutson said. \\\"We do allow kids at our facility too, but we have a strict rule about they have to stand up within arms reach of an adult. This is not a playground for kids. This is a playground for dogs.\\\"\\n\\nDog bars are also increasingly becoming a site of life's big moments. Multiple dog bars BI spoke with touted their singles events. Kulp said that couples have met, gotten engaged, and even gotten married at Wagbar.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nSome \\u2014 like the Dog Bar in Florida \\u2014 also use their spaces as a neutral ground for dog parents to meet adoptable dogs and see if their current pups get along with a potential new sibling. That neutral stomping ground has also made it a good space for broken-up dog couples to do custody hand-offs; Metzler has heard of one or two break-ups happening there, too.\\n\\n\\\"I think the individual was like, this was a good-energy place. My partner can only get so mad,\\\" he said.\\n\\nAnd as dog bars and dog-centric spaces have become a larger part of life for many Americans, some have also become a place for a send-off from life. Kulp said that a customer in his 80s found Wagbar, and came every day like clockwork. When he passed away, his family got in touch; they'd never been to the venue before, but they knew what a big impact it had on his final years. They decided to hold his memorial there \\u2014 with dogs in attendance.\\n\\n\\\"That's just not something you see at very many places and businesses,\\\" Kulp said. To him, that's a testament to the power of dogs. \\\"They just are a catalyst for that connection and conversation.\\\"\"\n",

      "            \"text\": \"A week after Hurricane Helene overwhelmed the Southeastern U.S., homeowners hit the hardest are grappling with how they could possibly pay for the flood damage from one of the deadliest storms to hit the mainland in recent history.\\n\\nThe Category 4 storm that first struck Florida\\u2019s Gulf Coast on September 26 has dumped trillions of gallons of water across several states, leaving a catastrophic trail of destruction that spans hundreds of miles inland. More than 200 people have died in what is now the deadliest hurricane to hit the mainland U.S. since Katrina, according to statistics from the National Hurricane Center.\\n\\nWestern North Carolina and the Asheville area were hit especially hard, with flooding that wiped out buildings, roads, utilities and land in a way that nobody expected, let alone prepared for. Inland areas in parts of Georgia and Tennessee were also washed out.\\n\\nThe Oak Forest neighborhood in south Asheville lives up to its name, with trees towering over 1960s era ranch-style houses on large lots. But on Sept. 27, as Helene\\u2019s remnants swept through western north Carolina, many of those trees came crashing down, sometimes landing on houses.\\n\\nJulianne Johnson said she was coming upstairs from the basement to help her 5-year-old son pick out clothes that day when her husband began to yell that a giant oak was falling diagonally across the yard. The tree mostly missed the house, but still crumpled part of a metal porch and damaged the roof. Then, Johnson said, her basement flooded.\\n\\nOn Friday, there was a blue tarp being held on the roof with a brick. Sodden carpet that the family torn out lay on the side of the house, waiting to go to the landfill. With no cell phone service or internet access, Johnson said she couldn\\u2019t file a home insurance claim until four days after the storm.\\n\\n\\u201cIt took me a while to make that call,\\u201d she said. \\u201cI don\\u2019t have an adjuster yet.\\u201d\\n\\nRoof and tree damage are likely to be covered by the average home insurance policy. But Johnson, like many homeowners, doesn\\u2019t have flood insurance and she\\u2019s not certain how she\\u2019ll pay for that part of the damage.\\n\\nThose recovering from the storm may be surprised to learn flood damage is a completely separate thing. Insurance professionals and experts have long warned that home insurance typically does not cover flood damage to the home, even as they espouse that flooding can happen anywhere that rains. That\\u2019s because flooding isn\\u2019t just sea water seeping into the land \\u2013 it\\u2019s also water from banks, as well as mudflow and torrential rains.\\n\\nBut most private insurance companies don\\u2019t carry flood insurance, leaving the National Flood Insurance Program run by the Federal Emergency Management Agency as the primary provider for that coverage for residential homes. Congress created the federal flood insurance program more than 50 years ago when many private insurers stopped offering policies in high-risk areas.\\n\\nNorth Carolina has 129,933 such policies in force, according to FEMA\\u2019s latest data, though most of that protection will likely be concentrated on the coast rather than in the Blue Ridge Mountains area where Helene caused the most damage. Florida, in comparison, has about 1.7 million flood policies in place statewide.\\n\\nCharlotte Hicks, a flood insurance expert in North Carolina who has led flood risk training and educational outreach for the state\\u2019s Department of Insurance, said the reality is that many Helene survivors will never be made whole. Without flood insurance, some people may be able to rebuild with the help of charities but most others will be left to fend for themselves.\\n\\n\\u201cThere will absolutely be people who will be financially devasted by this event,\\u201d Hicks said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s heartbreaking.\\u201d\\n\\nSome may go into foreclosure or bankruptcy. Entire neighborhoods will likely never be rebuilt. There\\u2019s been water damage across the board, Hicks said, and for some, mudslides have even taken the land upon which their house once stood.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Helene is turning out to be a fairly manageable disaster for the private home insurance market because those plans generally only serve to cover wind damage from hurricanes.\\n\\nThat\\u2019s a relief for the industry, which has been under increasing strain from other intensifying climate disasters such as wildfires and tornadoes. Nowhere is the shrinking private market due to climate instability more evident than in Florida, where many companies have already stopped selling policies \\u2014 leaving the state-backed Citizens Property Insurance Corporation now the largest home insurer in the state.\\n\\nMark Friedlander, spokesman for the Insurance Information Institute, an industry group, said Helene is a \\u201cvery manageable loss event,\\u201d and estimates insurer losses will range from about $5 billion to $8 billion. That\\u2019s compared to the insured losses from the Category 4 Hurricane Ian in September 2022 that was estimated in excess of $50 billion.\\n\\nFriedlander and other experts point out that less than 1% of the inland areas that sustained the most catastrophic flood damage were protected with flood insurance.\\n\\n\\u201cThis is very common in inland communities across the country,\\u201d Friedlander said. \\u201c Lack of flood insurance is a major insurance gap in the U.S., as only about 6% of homeowners carry the coverage, mostly in coastal counties.\\u201d\\n\\nAmy Bach, executive director of the consumer advocacy group United Policyholders, said the images of the flood destruction in North Carolina shook her despite decades of seeing challenging recovery faced by victims of natural disasters.\\n\\n\\u201cThis is a pretty serious situation here in terms of people disappointed. They are going to be disappointed in their insurers and they are going to be disappointed in FEMA,\\u201d Bach said. \\u201cFEMA cannot match the kind of dollars private insurers are supposed to be contributing to the recovery.\\u201d\\n\\nThis week, FEMA announced it could meet the immediate needs of Helene but warned it doesn\\u2019t have enough funding to make it through the hurricane season, which runs June 1 to Nov. 30 though most hurricanes typically occur in September and October.\\n\\nEven if a homeowner does have it, FEMA\\u2019s National Flood Insurance Program only covers up to $250,000 for single-family homes and $100,000 for contents.\\n\\nBach said that along with homeowners educating themselves about what their policies do and don\\u2019t cover, the solution is a national disaster insurance program that does for property insurance what the Affordable Care Act did for health insurance.\\n\\nAfter Hurricane Floyd in 1999, the state of North Carolina started requiring insurance agents to take a flood insurance class so they could properly advise their clients of the risk and policies available, Hicks said. The state also requires home insurance policies to clearly disclose that it does not cover flood.\\n\\n\\u201cYou can\\u2019t stop nature from doing what nature is going to do,\\u201d Hicks said. \\u201cFor us to think it\\u2019s never going to be this bad again would be a dangerous assumption. A lot of people underestimate their risk of flooding.\\u201d\"\n",

      "            \"text\": \"There\\u2019s at least one thing most Americans can agree on, no matter where they live or who they vote for: home prices are too high. There are some signs relief is coming, particularly after the long-awaited rate cut by the Federal Reserve in September. Still, Fed Chair Jerome Powell has said the crux of the country\\u2019s housing crisis is a supply issue\\u2014something the central bank can\\u2019t address.\\n\\nTo put it plainly, there are just not enough homes to go around. The issue has, unsurprisingly, become a major theme on the presidential campaign trail. Vice President Kamala Harris is calling for subsidized construction and expanding assistance to first-time homebuyers. Donald Trump has promised to get rates lower, reduce red tape, and crack down on immigration to reduce competition for scarce homes.\\n\\nMeanwhile, senior White House economist Jared Bernstein has opinions of his own. Shortly after the Fed\\u2019s September rate cut, Bernstein spoke with Fortune to share what he sees as the necessary measures to solve the nation\\u2019s housing shortage. Some of the fixes, he said, are relatively straightforward.\\n\\n\\u201cFrom the perspective of developers, building affordable housing just does not pencil out,\\u201d said Bernstein, chair of the president\\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers.\\n\\nIncentives to build such housing, he said, are required to help developers get a return on their investment.\\n\\n\\u201cIn no small part,\\u201d he said, \\u201cbecause low- and even middle-income people can\\u2019t always pay what it costs to develop such properties, and that is a very clear market failure.\\u201d\\n\\nOne tried and true measure of fixing this \\u201cROI problem\\u201d for multifamily housing, he said, is the low-income housing tax credit, which requires developers to reserve a certain percentage of rent-restricted units for lower-income families. According to the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, it\\u2019s by far the largest federal program encouraging affordable rental housing for low-income households.\\n\\nThe Joint Committee on Taxation estimates the program will cost $15.2 billion by 2025. President Joe Biden\\u2019s proposed annual budget in March called for a $37 billion expansion of the credit, as well as cutting a private bond financing requirement in half to create more deals.\\n\\nMany critics say various intermediaries take a cut of the credit, meaning a significant part of the subsidy does not go to creating new housing stock, and add that the credit can inflate housing prices overall. At the same time, some state authorities tend to approve projects that concentrate low-income developments in areas where they have historically been clustered and where economic opportunities are limited, according to the Tax Policy Center.\\n\\nGetting around \\u201cNIMBYism\\u201d\\n\\nBernstein, who mentioned similar incentives for building affordable single-family housing, is known as a staunch progressive. Both Republicans and Democrats across the country, however, agree with him that restrictive land use policies are also a major obstacle to addressing the housing shortfall.\\n\\nMany states and cities are trying to alter zoning rules to allow for greater population density, particularly by enabling duplexes and triplexes to be built in neighborhoods designed for single-family homes. Blowback from homeowners, however, can snuff these efforts out.\\n\\nWhen residents say \\u201cnot in my backyard,\\u201d a phenomenon famously known in the real estate industry as NIMBYism, they often pack city or town council meetings and pressure local officials to block such changes. Even when states pass laws to limit the ability of cities to say no, people find other barriers, according to Sean Dobson, chairman and CEO of the Amherst Group.\\n\\n\\u201cAnd it\\u2019s this tension between the cities trying to create more housing and the landowners trying to preserve what their view is of housing, [that] is really the source of the friction,\\u201d Dobson said at Fortune\\u2019s Future of Finance Conference in May.\\n\\nBernstein believes that\\u2019s where the federal government can help. In 2022, a $1.7 trillion spending package from Congress included $85 million in grants to states and cities implementing zoning reform. Programs from the Department of Transportation and Department of Housing and Urban Development have similar components.\\n\\n\\u201cWhen we structure some of the grants and loans that we provide,\\u201d Bernstein explained, \\u201cwe say, \\u2018Look, if you want an infrastructure grant, that\\u2019s great. We want to give it to you. Tell us how you\\u2019re going to free up some exclusionary zoning, and we\\u2019ll make sure you have a better chance of getting that bid.\\u2019\\u201d\\n\\nMaybe that will lead to some more homes\\u2014and lower prices.\"\n",

Prime Day started as a summertime sale, and Amazon held the event for the first time in July 2015. It added the fall version in 2022 (though Prime Day 2020 also took place in October that year due to delays from the pandemic).\\n\\n\\\"Things that didn't do as well during the July Prime Day can be cleared out so that they can then start focusing on the other goods that they want to sell during the holidays,\\\" said Sky Canaves, a principal analyst who covers retail and e-commerce at Emarketer, a sister company to Business Insider.\\n\\nRelated stories\\n\\nUS consumer spending data and company earnings this summer suggested that shoppers are pulling back on their purchases to varying degrees.\\n\\nWhile many low-income people are focusing on food and other essentials, more affluent middle- and upper-income consumers still have money to spend on clothing, home decor, and other small luxuries. But they are being more thrifty than they were a few years ago.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAmazon's Prime members tend to fit into the latter group, Wathieu said. They are willing to pay Amazon's monthly or annual fees for Prime, after all. \\\"They're a little bit less price sensitive\\\" than shoppers who have to delay their purchases until closer to the holidays, he said.\\n\\nOffering outdoor gear, yard tools, and other out-of-season products during October's event is likely one way that Amazon is trying to get Prime members to spend more, Wathieu said. \\\"You have to see this more as a strategic move from Amazon to leverage what their capabilities are, including having swayed everyone into Prime membership that they need to leverage,\\\" he said.\\n\\nAn Amazon spokesperson said, \\\"Right now, we are focused on making this year's event special for our members and are excited to offer exclusive early savings this holiday season.\\\" The spokesperson did not comment directly on Amazon's strategy for sourcing the deals.\\n\\n\\\"We know saving is important to our Prime members, and we are excited to provide members deep discounts and millions of deals worldwide from top categories including electronics, home, toys, beauty, and apparel,\\\" and on brands like Dyson and Barbie, the spokesperson added.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nOther retailers are offering their own October sales this year, giving Amazon some competition. Walmart's Holiday Deals sale starts on October 8, the first day of Prime Day, and runs through October 13. Target Circle Week kicks off on October 6 this year.\\n\\nEven retailers outside the big-box sphere are participating. Home Depot started its D\\u00e9cor Days sale on Thursday, marking the second year for the sale. Rival Lowe's, meanwhile, will launch MyLowe's Rewards Week, the home improvement chain's first October sale, on Thursday.\\n\\nBut all those sales at once might be too much for shoppers. Sixty-seven percent said that they expect to \\\"feel overwhelmed with marketing messages\\\" from retailers about holiday sales by November 1, according to research firm Optimove Insights. The survey, conducted in July, polled 280 US shoppers over the age of 21 from households with incomes of $75,000 or more.\\n\\nEven devout Amazon shoppers might feel burned out on sales, with the retailer's October sale coming less than three months after July's Prime Day, Canaves said.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\\"There is a risk of holiday marketing fatigue,\\\" she said.\\n\\nDo you work for Amazon and have a story idea to share?

The sampling, completed in early 2023, involved employers in eight countries, including the US and the UK, hiring for technology positions across over a dozen industries.\\n\\n\\\"The entry-level job has vanished in many ways,\\\" Mourshed said.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nManagers don't want to babysit\\n\\nFor its survey, Generation gathered data from some 1,300 employers from November 2022 to January 2023 on what they required regarding work experience and formal education.\\n\\nRelated stories\\n\\nMourshed noted that during the pandemic \\u2014 and after \\u2014 people in fields like tech often worked from home. At the same time, many managers have reported feeling stressed out. That's one reason, she said, why having workers who required less guidance was ideal for many bosses.\\n\\n\\\"They had very strong preferences to hire people who were more stand-alone, who they felt wouldn't require as much oversight, because everyone is working remotely,\\\" Mourshed said.\\n\\nSome companies have also been holding onto fewer middle managers, she said.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\\"When you have an insufficient middle layer, then what you begin to do is to increase the requirements of the entry-level,\\\" Mourshed said.\\n\\nShe also said that even as the pandemic eased its grip, many employers didn't relax requirements for their starter tech hires.\\n\\n\\\"It never went back,\\\" Mourshed said.\\n\\nBeyond raising their standards for entry-level positions, some employers in various industries simply aren't posting as many of these jobs.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nFor every 1 million listings on Indeed, the share of entry-level roles fell 6.9% between August 2022 and August 2024, a spokesperson told BI. In its analysis, Indeed categorized starter jobs as requiring no more than a year of experience or preferring no more than two years of experience.\\n\\nJason Henninger is a managing director at Heller Search, a recruiting firm focused on executive tech leaders. In a prior role, he spent more than 15 years filling staff-level tech jobs. Henninger said that, for years now, many employers have been ratcheting up what they expect from those seeking starter positions.\\n\\nEmployers that dangle remote work as an option have extra leverage, he said.\\n\\n\\\"Maybe you don't have to take a shot on a fresh college grad or someone that has one year of experience because someone has five years' experience and will be willing to take that same amount of pay because they can sit in their own home,\\\" Henninger said.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nCorey Moss-Pech is an assistant professor of sociology at Florida State University and author of the forthcoming book \\\"Major Trade-Offs,\\\" which examines the relationship between students' majors and entry-level jobs.

Nearly half of the postings have five or fewer applicants, and about 15% have no applicants.\\n\\nNeef said one reason some students might feel stymied in their search for a first job is that many tend to focus on companies with strong consumer brands. Yet, she added, there is an enormous opportunity with small to midsize employers.\\n\\nIn a typical year, only about 100 employers would hire five or more graduating Illini, Neef said. Yet, some 2,500 smaller employers tend to hire fewer than five of the university's grads.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\\"That's always where the bulk of the jobs are,\\\" she said, referring to small and midsize employers. In some cases, students aren't aware of them because the employers are regional, Neef said.\\n\\n\\\"Students may not perceive them to be as prestigious, but they have opportunities,\\\" she said.\\n\\nHunting for experience\\n\\nAfter struggling with his job search after college, Rod Danan went on to become a career coach. Then, in 2021, he started a company called Prentus that uses artificial intelligence and other tools designed to help job seekers land roles faster.\\n\\nDanan told BI that many of the students that he works with are struggling to find internships because many employers appear to be trimming the programs that could help train the next generation.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nNumbers from Handshake, a job site for college students, show employers pulled back last summer. The number of available internships created on Handshake dropped 7.5% from May 2023 to May 2024, according to the company.

But perhaps the most important variable for whether equities can keep rolling returns to the spotlight this week: corporate earnings.\\n\\nThe S&P 500 Index has soared roughly 20% in 2024, adding more than $8 trillion to its market capitalization. The gains have largely been driven by expectations of easing monetary policy and resilient profit outlooks.\\n\\nBut the tide may be turning as analysts slice their expectations for third-quarter results. Companies in the S&P 500 are expected to report a 4.7% increase in quarterly earnings from a year ago, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence. That\\u2019s down from projections of 7.9% on July 12, and it would represent the weakest increase in four quarters, BI data show.\\n\\n\\u201cThe earnings season will be more important than normal this time,\\u201d said Adam Parker, founder of Trivariate Research. \\u201cWe need concrete data from corporates.\\u201c\\n\\nIn particular, investors are eager to see if companies are postponing spending, if demand has slowed, and if customers are behaving differently due to geopolitical risk and macro uncertainty, Parker said. \\u201cIt is exactly because there is a lot going on in the world that corporate earnings and guidance will particularly matter now,\\u201d he said.\\n\\nReports from major companies start arriving this week, with results from Delta Air Lines Inc. due Thursday and JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Wells Fargo & Co. scheduled for Friday.\\n\\n\\u201cEarnings seasons are typically positive for equities,\\u201d said Binky Chadha, chief US equity and global Strategist at Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. \\u201cBut the strong rally and above-average positioning going in (to this earnings season) argue for a muted market reaction.\\u201d\\n\\nObstacles Abound\\n\\nThe obstacles facing investors right now are no secret. The US presidential election is just a month away with Democrat Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump in a tight, fierce race. The Federal Reserve has just started lowering interest rates, and while there\\u2019s optimism about an economic soft-landing, questions remain about how fast central bankers will reduce borrowing costs. And a deepening conflict in the Middle East is raising concerns about inflation heating up again, with the price of West Texas Intermediate oil rising 9% last week, the biggest weekly gain March 2023.\\n\\nRead more: Mideast War Risk Puts Spotlight on Iran\\u2019s Quiet Oil Comeback\\n\\n\\u201cThe bottom line is that revisions and guidance are weak, indicating lingering concerns about the economy and reflecting some election year seasonality,\\u201d said Dennis DeBusschere of 22V Research. \\u201cThat is helping set up reporting season as another uncertainty clearing event.\\u201d\\n\\nPlus, to make matters more challenging, big institutional investors have little buying power at the moment and seasonal market trends are soft.\\n\\nPositioning in trend-following systematic funds is now skewed to the downside, and options market positioning shows traders may not be ready to buy any dips. Commodity trading advisers, or CTAs, are expected to sell US stocks even if the market stays flat in the next month, according to data from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. And volatility control funds, which buy stocks when volatility drops, no longer have room to add exposure.\\n\\nHistory appears to side with the pessimists, too. Since 1945, when the S&P 500 gained 20% through the first nine months of the year, it posted a down October 70% of the time, data compiled by Bespoke Investment Research show. The index gained 21% this year through September.\\n\\nBar Lowered\\n\\nStill, there\\u2019s reason for optimism, specifically a lowered bar for earnings projections that leaves companies more room to beat expectations.\\n\\n\\u201cEstimates got a little bit too optimistic, and now they\\u2019re pulling back to more realistic levels,\\u201d said Ellen Hazen, chief market strategist at F.L.Putnam Investment Management. \\u201cIt will definitely be easier to beat earnings because estimates are lower now.\\u201d\\n\\nIn fact, there\\u2019s plenty of data suggesting that US companies remain fundamentally resilient. A strengthening earnings cycle should continue to offset stubbornly weak economic signals, tipping the scales for equities in a positive direction, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. Even struggling small-cap stocks, which have lagged their large-cap peers this year, are expected to see improving margins, BI\\u2019s Michael Casper wrote.\\n\\nFriday\\u2019s jobs report, which showed the unemployment rate unexpectedly declined, quelled some concerns about a soft labor market.\\n\\nAnother factor is the Fed\\u2019s easing cycle, which has historically been a boon for US equities. Since 1971, the S&P 500 has posted an annualized return of 15% during periods in which the central bank cut rates, data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence show.\\n\\nThose gains have been even stronger when rate-cutting cycles hit in non-recessionary periods. In those cases, large caps posted an averaged annualized return of 25% compared with 11% when there was a recession, while small caps gained 20% in non-recessionary periods compared with 17% when there was a recession.\\n\\n\\u201cUnless earnings are a major disappointment, I think the Fed will be a bigger influence over markets between now and year-end simply because earnings have been pretty consistent,\\u201d said Tom Essaye, founder and president of Sevens Report Research. \\u201cInvestors expect that to continue.\\u201d\"\n",

Instead, Friday\\u2019s report revived a whole new set of worries around overheating, spoiling the rally in Treasuries that had sent two-year yields to a multiyear low.\\n\\n\\u201cThe pain trade was always higher-front end rates due to less rate cuts being priced in,\\u201d said George Catrambone, head of fixed income, DWS Americas. \\u201cWhat could happen is the Fed either delivers no more rate cuts, or actually finds itself having to raise rates again.\\u201d\\n\\nMuch of the recent market debate had centered on whether the economy would be able to achieve the \\u201csoft landing\\u201d of deceleration without recession, or veer into the \\u201chard landing\\u201d of a severe downturn. The Fed itself had signaled a shift in focus toward preventing a deterioration in the job market after fighting inflation for more than two years, and its pivot to rate cuts began with a half-point bang in September.\\n\\nBut Friday\\u2019s payroll report provided ammunition for those who see a disconnect in the Fed cutting rates when stocks are at record high, the economy is expanding at a solid pace and inflation has yet to return to the Fed\\u2019s target. In short, a no-landing scenario.\\n\\nA number of prominent investors and economists, including Stanley Druckenmiller and Mohamed El-Erian, cautioned that the Fed shouldn\\u2019t be boxed in by market projections for lower rates or its own projections, with El-Erian warning \\u201cinflation is not dead.\\u201d Former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers said in a post on X Friday that \\u201cno landing\\u201d and \\u201chard landing\\u201d are risks the Fed has to reckon with, saying last month\\u2019s outsized cut was \\u201ca mistake.\\u201d\\n\\nFor some, the Fed\\u2019s outsized reduction last month, combined with China\\u2019s surprising stimulus blitz, tilt the balance away from growth concerns.\\n\\n\\u201cThe 50-basis-point cut should be out of question now,\\u201d said Tracy Chen, portfolio manager at Brandywine Global Investment Management. \\u201cThe Fed\\u2019s easing and China\\u2019s stimulus increases the likelihood of a no landing.\\u201d\\n\\nMeanwhile, inflation concerns are reviving after crude oil surged. The 10-year breakeven rate, a measure of bond traders\\u2019 inflation expectations, reached a two-month high, rebounding from a three-year low in mid-September. That\\u2019s ahead of key data on consumer prices due next week.\\n\\nRead More: Global Bond Traders Are Seeking Protection From Inflation Threat\\n\\nSwap traders are pricing in 24 basis points of easing for the November Fed meeting, meaning that a quarter-point reduction is no longer seen as guaranteed. A total of 150 basis points of easing is priced in through October 2025, down from the expectations of reductions about 200 basis points in late September.\\n\\nThe scaling back of Fed expectations has poured cold water on the bond buying frenzy that helped Treasuries clock in five straight monthly gains, the best stretch since 2010. Ten-year Treasury yields have jumped more than 30 basis points since the Fed\\u2019s meeting last month, approaching 4% for the first time since August.\\n\\n\\u201cThe Fed has highlighted the importance of the labor market in its dual mandate, which prompted the jumbo cut last month and now here we are with evidence that the labor market is in fine fettle,\\u201d said Baylor Lancaster-Samuel, chief investment officer at Amerant Investments Inc. \\u201cIt is definitely somewhat in the category of \\u2018Be careful what you wish for.\\u2019\\u201d\\n\\nThe shifting narrative also upended a recent popular strategy to bet on aggressive Fed easing: so-called curve steepening. In such a strategy, traders wager short-term notes would outperform longer-maturity debt. Instead, two-year yields jumped 36 basis points last week, the most since June 2022. At 3.9%, the two-year yields are only 6 basis points below 10-year notes, narrowing from 22 basis points in late September.\\n\\nWith a renewed focus on inflation, next week\\u2019s consumer price report looms large. It\\u2019s expected to show core consumer price index cooled to 0.2% last month after rising 0.3% in September. Fed Governor Christopher Waller has said inflation data he got shortly before the Sept. 18 policy meeting ultimately pushed him to support a half-point move.\\n\\nTo be sure, the current market pricing suggests a soft-landing scenario remains the investors\\u2019 base case. At 2.2%, the 10-year breakeven is still largely in line with Fed\\u2019s 2% inflation target. The swap market shows traders expect the Fed will end its easing cycle at about 2.9% in 2027, consistent with the level broadly viewed as neutral.\\n\\nJamie Patton, co-head of global rates at TCW, says the latest reading on jobs isn\\u2019t enough to change the need for the Fed to keep firmly on the easing path because the totality of data, including the falling quit rate and rising default rates in auto loans and credit cards, points to a softening job market and downside risks to the economy.\\n\\n\\u201cOne data point doesn\\u2019t change our macro view that the labor market is overall weakening,\\u201d Patton said.\\n\\nShe said she took advantage of Friday\\u2019s selloff to purchase more two- and five-year notes, adding to a curve-steepener position. \\u201cThe reignition of inflation fears could keep the Fed from cutting,\\u201d but that would raise the risk for the Fed to keep borrowing costs \\u201ctoo high for too long and in the end cause a larger downturn.\\u201d\"\n",

These firms were hurt a lot on a relative basis so if they discuss a meaningful reduction in debt service pressures that would be bullish for a broadening out in those smaller cap names,\\\" Dickson said.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nLower interest rates also have an outsized impact on the housing market, and homebuilders can offer solid guidance on what they're seeing in that market.\\n\\n\\\"Lower mortgage rates are breathing some life back into the housing market, evidenced by a ramp up in weekly mortgage applications by almost 50% since the end of July, to the highest point since mid-2022,\\\" Hainlin said.\\n\\nHe added: \\\"Lower mortgage rates should push up housing demand, bring some additional inventory online, and provide a modest boost to home sales and housing-related consumer spending.\\\"\"\n",

According to Fed data, the total aggregate wealth of American households grew by about $50 trillion in the last five years. That means many middle-income households that couldn't afford retirement just a few years ago now can, Kelly says.\\n\\nAs a result, investors shouldn't take on more risk than they need to, he says.\\n\\n\\\"They should dial back risk. There's no need to increase risk if you've got enough money to do the things that you want to do,\\\" Kelly said.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nKelly was particularly cautious over keeping money tied up in high-flying growth stocks.\\n\\n\\\"At the very time when I think logic would dictate that investors take a little bit of risk off the table, they are passively allowing risk to accumulate on the table,\\\" he said.\\n\\nInstead, he recommended investors rebalance their portfolios, funneling funds out of growth stocks and toward value shares, international equities, and alternatives.\\n\\nKelly says the market has been trending toward a soft landing for quite some time, and Friday's blockbuster jobs report only strengthened the case. The report showed a dip in the unemployment rate from 4.2% to 4.1%, with 254,000 nonfarm payrolls added, blowing past estimates of around 150,000.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThe strong report all but dashed hopes for another big rate cut next month, with investors quickly lowering the odds of a 50 basis point move from 33% to less than 1%, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.\\n\\nKelly acknowledged, though, that the data leaves room for error, so it's possible that last month's employment appeared weaker than reality and this month seemed stronger than reality.\\n\\nRegardless, he says the report validates that the US has a healthy, strong labor market and that the economy is on a \\\"very nice soft landing path.\\\"\\n\\nKelly expects the Fed to cut an additional 50 basis points over the course of its next two meetings, and another 100 next year.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nBack in August, when a surprise increase in unemployment triggered a massive global sell-off, Kelly told Business Insider that the Fed needs to do more to broadcast its confidence in the economy.\\n\\nNow, he says the Fed should continue showing its confidence, and show that it can take its time cutting interest rates.\\n\\n\\\"The more the Federal Reserve seems to be taking its time and not overly concerned, the more that's going to do to support confidence,\\\" he said.\"\n",

They're also hitting employment and economic growth, at least in the short term.\\n\\n\\\"Hurricanes are the most costly weather and climate extreme event to impact the US historically, in terms of total dollars and average cost per event,\\\" Adam Smith, a climate scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), told Business Insider.\\n\\nThe US has experienced 363 billion-dollar weather disasters costing a total of $2.6 trillion between 1980 and August 2023, NOAA data shows. Hurricanes accounted for $1.3 trillion or about half the total cost, an average of $22.8 billion per storm.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThe number of hurricanes striking the mainland US has also jumped from 12 between 1961 and 1970 and between 1971 and 1980, to 18 between 2001 and 2010, and 19 between 2011 and 2020, per NOAA data.\\n\\nHelene has caused an estimated $34 billion worth of destruction, and Milton threatens to deal tens of billions of dollars in damage too, Jefferies analysts said in a note this week.\\n\\nRelated stories\\n\\nHurricane Harvey in 2017 and Hurricane Ian in 2022 cost an estimated $159 billion and $119 billion each, ranking behind only Hurricane Katrina's $200 billion toll in 2005.\\n\\nHurricanes are becoming more costly because the amount and value of assets exposed and vulnerable to storm damage has increased, Smith said.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nHe also said that climate change \\u2014 higher ocean surface temperatures fuel stronger hurricanes, and warmer air carries more rain \\u2014 has led to more rainfall, a greater risk of storm surges, and a higher chance of rapid intensification.\\n\\nThe most severe storms have become more intense with about a 10% rise in maximum sustained winds on average, leading to a \\\"roughly 33% increase in destructive potential,\\\" Michael Mann, a climate expert at the University of Pennsylvania, told BI.\\n\\nEconomic impacts\\n\\nBefore Milton made landfall, analysts at Oxford Economics said in a note that about 2.8% of US GDP was in its direct path. They estimated that a Category 5 storm could lower fourth-quarter annualized GDP growth by 0.14 percentage points, from a forecasted 2.3% to below 2.2%. Milton was downgraded to Category 3 before striking Florida.\\n\\n\\\"For Milton, tourism, trade and transportation will be hit,\\\" Ryan Sweet, Oxford's chief US economist, told BI.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nHelene is already poised to reduce nonfarm payrolls for October by 40,000 to 50,000 jobs, and Milton could deal a further blow to employment, he said. Job growth was trending at 167,000 a month, but that number could end up being under 100,000 this month in light of the Boeing strikes and Helene, even before accounting for Milton, Sweet said.\\n\\nThe most economically impactful hurricanes disrupt energy infrastructure like offshore rigs and refineries, driving up national gas prices. They can also hit home sales and housing starts, and extensive flooding can delay the return of people who evacuated affected areas, and hamper rebuilding efforts, Sweet said.\\n\\nNew research finds that hurricanes harm human health more than previously thought, exacerbated by climate change fueling more damaging storms. The upshot is \\\"far more death and destruction,\\\" Mann told BI.\\n\\nHe said hurricanes are causing \\\"more death and disease, which definitely propagates through the economy.\\\"\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAfter the storm\\n\\nSome research suggests the economic costs of hurricanes are largely offset by the rebuilding efforts that follow. Repairs following a single hurricane can indirectly support nearly 248,000 jobs, generate over $17 billion of labor income, and contribute more than $30 billion to GDP, according to Implan, an economic data provider.\\n\\nIn effect, every dollar spent on hurricane repairs generates another $1.72 in the economy, benefiting sectors ranging from retail and housing to banking and oil refining, Implan said.\\n\\n\\\"Rebuilding should provide a boost to economic activity in those affected regions in subsequent months, and potentially years,\\\" Sweet told BI, quoting from his recent note. \\\"A ton of federal and insurance money will flow into the impacted areas, which will boost economic activity.\\\"\\n\\nThe damage might be offset for now, but whether that will continue with rising temperatures and soaring costs remains uncertain.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nEventually, \\\"increasing hurricane damages will exceed the coping capacities\\\" of the US economy, according to a 2022 paper published by the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research.\"\n",

He officially entered politics on June 17, 2015, when he announced he was entering his first presidential race. Trump's presidency altered the very fabric of the Republican Party, bucking traditional conservative values and ushering in the MAGA era.\\n\\nMore than nine years after his initial campaign announcement, Trump is in the home stretch of his third bid for the White House and in a virtual dead-heat with Kamala Harris. His most recent campaign has brought about wild, unprecedented moments, including two apparent assassination attempts.\\n\\nTrump's support ranges from his loyal base of largely white working-class voters to billionaires like Elon Musk. Here's a look at the personal history and wide-ranging career of America's 45th president.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nDonald Trump's early life and family\\n\\nDonald John Trump was born on June 14, 1946, in Queens, New York. At 78 years old, he is the oldest person to run for president now that President Joe Biden has dropped out of the race. Compared to other former presidents, Trump has released relatively little information on his physical health. In November of 2023, his personal physician said measures of his physical health were within the normal range but did not provide details about his medication, blood pressure, or cholesterol. Standing at a reported height of 6-foot-3, some have expressed concern about Trump's weight in the past.\\n\\nHis parents, real estate developer Fred Trump and Mary MacLeod, met at a party and got married in 1936. They had five children, with Donald Trump being their fourth. He attended a presbyterian church as a child, but doesn't seem to have a close religious affiliation nor regularly attend religious services.\\n\\nFred Trump made much of his fortune in New York City real estate and was the subject of a Senate investigation related to taking advantage of a federal loan program. He was never charged but was barred from getting federal loan guarantees after admitting wrongdoing.\\n\\nAs a teenager, Donald Trump attended New York Military Academy, a private military school. After graduating, he attended Fordham University in the Bronx for two years before eventually switching to the Wharton School of Finance and Economics at the University of Pennsylvania. Trump graduated from Wharton with a bachelor's degree in economics and talks about his time at the prestigious institution often.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nTrump grew up in Queens, New York. NICHOLAS KAMM/Getty Images\\n\\nDonald Trump's career in business and reality television\\n\\nAfter graduating college, Trump began working for his father and eventually became the president of a collection of family-owned companies that he later turned into the Trump Organization. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Trump expanded his dad's business and invested in Manhattan hotels. He was buoyed along by financial and social help from his father, whose New York connections ran deep.\\n\\nIn 1983, Trump opened Trump Tower on 56th Street and 5th Avenue, where he later had an apartment. That same decade, Trump started investing in casinos and bought Mar-a-Lago, his resort in Palm Beach, Florida.\\n\\nThe 1990s recession harmed Trump's businesses and he was forced to sell various assets, as well as commit to a personal budget. His luck largely changed by the end of the 1990s, though his casinos continued to struggle.\\n\\nTrump profited from his name throughout his long business career, selling everything from branded cologne and steaks to an online education company. In 2018, the New York Times published a lengthy investigation detailing how Fred Trump funneled money to his son through both illegal and legal means. The outlet reported Donald Trump received the equivalent of $413 million from his dad by the early 2000s.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nIn 1996, Trump teamed up with NBC to buy the Miss Universe Organization, which encompasses the Miss Universe, Miss USA, and Miss Teen USA beauty pageants. Trump then starred in a reality television show of his own \\u2014 The Apprentice. The Emmy-nominated program made him nearly $200 million over 16 years and boosted his image as a self-made billionaire.\\n\\nTrump's net worth was $3.8 billion as of September 2024, according to Forbes.\\n\\nIn addition to starring in The Apprentice, Trump owned the Miss Universe and Miss USA pageants. D Dipasupil/Getty Images\\n\\nDonald Trump's various marriages and children\\n\\nDonald Trump has a checkered marital history, marked by various divorces and alleged affairs.\\n\\nHe met his first wife, Czech model Ivana Marie Zeln\\u00ed\\u010dkov\\u00e1, in 1976 when she was in New York City for a fashion show. The two got married in 1977 and remained a fixture of the city's tabloid scene. They had three children together: Ivanka, Donald Jr., and Eric.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nRumors about Trump having affairs swirled throughout the marriage, including with American actress Marla Maples. Ivana and Trump got divorced in 1992.\\n\\nOne year later, Maples had Trump's fourth child, Tiffany. The couple got married two months later but split up in 1999.\\n\\nRelated stories\\n\\nTrump's current wife, Melania Trump (n\\u00e9e Knauss), is a Slovenian-American former model whom he met in 1998 at a mutual friend's party. The two dated on and off before tying the knot in 2004 at Mar-a-Lago. The star-studded guest list included the Clintons and Billy Joel.\\n\\nTrump's fifth child, Barron Trump, was born in 2006. When Trump moved into the White House, Melania and Barron waited months before joining him at the residence.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nTrump has been married three times. His current wife is Melania Trump. JIM WATSON\\n\\nDonald Trump's political rise and the 2016 election\\n\\nA somewhat ubiquitous presence in American life since the 1980s, Trump floated running for president since his early days as a businessman. People generally didn't take him seriously and his political affiliations flip-flopped \\u2014 he went from being a registered Democrat, to a registered Republican, to the frontman for a remade American conservatism.\\n\\nIn 2012, Trump gained prominence in Republican circles for popularizing the \\\"birther\\\" theory \\u2014 the racist and false claim that former President Barack Obama was not born in the United States. And in the summer of 2015, the prospect of a Trump presidential bid became much more real when he announced his candidacy at a campaign rally in New York City.\\n\\nThroughout the 2016 campaign, Trump positioned himself as a political outsider and built his platform around economic prosperity, immigration, and a newly combative rhetoric. His campaign was mired in controversy \\u2014 from the Access Hollywood tape where he bragged about groping women to his failure to quickly denounce the KKK \\u2014 but he appealed to a wide swath of Americans.\\n\\nDespite doing poorly in the early Iowa caucus, Trump triumphed in a series of primary wins and had a strong performance on Super Tuesday. After becoming the Republican nominee, Trump trailed Hillary Clinton in the polls but ended up victorious on November 8, 2016. He lost the popular vote by more than 2.8 million but won 304 electoral votes to Clinton's 227.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nTrump shocked the country when he won the 2016 presidential election. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\\n\\nDonald Trump's presidency\\n\\nOnce in the White House, Trump was quick to issue a slate of executive orders based on his campaign promises, including building a wall on the southern border and implementing his proposed \\\"Muslim ban,\\\" which quickly faced legal challenges.\\n\\nWhile running for office, Trump promised to repeal the Affordable Care Act, but doing so proved difficult and contentious and he instead chipped away at the law. He also repealed many Obama-era environment policies and withdrew from the Paris Climate Agreement because he believed it damaged the economy.\\n\\nTrump took an isolationist approach to foreign policy, imposing tariffs and withdrawing from revising longstanding trade agreements. On the question of the economy, Trump pushed a $1.5 trillion tax cut package through Congress. And regarding the Supreme Court, he appointed three conservative judges and takes credit for the overturning of Roe v. Wade.\\n\\nBy his final years in office, Trump was both president and candidate \\u2014 he launched his reelection bid in June of 2019. The COVID-19 pandemic upended both the election and the end of Trump's presidency. He didn't adopt aggressive measures to curb the spread of the virus early on, and President Joe Biden accused him of ignoring the crisis throughout the election. Trump came down with COVID-19 himself during the final weeks of the campaign and received treatment at Walter Reed Medical Center, benefitting from drugs few Americans could access.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nWhen election day did finally roll around, Trump eventually lost both the popular and electoral college vote. The race was extremely close in key states and took days to call. Trump declared victory one day after the election, before all the votes were tallied, and thus inaugurated his months-long campaign contesting the election results.\\n\\nAfter leaving office in January of 2021, Trump and Melania moved to Mar-a-Lago, where he currently lives.\\n\\nDuring Trump's presidency, he passed a slate of controversial executive orders to fulfill campaign promises. Chip Somodevilla\\n\\nDonald Trump's controversies and ongoing legal woes\\n\\nDonald Trump's legal troubles stretch back to the very beginning of his business career. In 1973, the US Justice Department sued Fred and Donald Trump for allegedly violating the Fair Housing Act in various New York City apartment buildings. The parties settled the suit two years later and the Trumps did not admit to any wrongdoing.\\n\\nTrump's political rise is backlit by controversy as well, from the personal scandals that have plagued his candidacies to his new status as the first former president convicted of a federal crime. The FBI investigated Russian interference in the 2016 election, but ultimately concluded that there wasn't sufficient evidence to prove that \\\"members of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government.\\\" Yet the report did find \\\"numerous links\\\" between the two groups.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nWhile in office, Trump was impeached twice by the House of Representatives, but the Senate acquitted him both times.\\n\\nThe chamber first impeached him in 2019 on articles charging him with abuses of power and obstruction of justice. He is accused of offering Ukraine a quid-quo-pro: dig up dirt on Biden in exchange for military aid.\\n\\nRelated stories\\n\\nThe second impeachment articles relate to his ongoing efforts to overturn the 2020 election and actions on Jan. 6, 2021, when a violent mob stormed the Capitol. As lawmakers convened to certify the election results, Trump encouraged his supporters to attend a rally in DC to protest the joint session of Congress. Thousands showed up, including some from white supremacist groups and right-wing militias.\\n\\nWhen speaking to the crowd, Trump did not explicitly call for violence, but encouraged his followers to \\\"fight like hell\\\" \\u2014 many of those same followers stormed the Capitol building moments later, overwhelming police and forcing lawmakers to flee. Five people died during or shortly after the event, including a Capitol police officer.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nCongress reconvened to certify the election results in the early hours of Jan. 7 and Biden was inaugurated on Jan. 20, 2021. Meanwhile, Trump continues to deny that he lost the election in 2020, refusing to admit defeat to this day. Many fear that he will contest the 2024 election results if he loses.\\n\\nThe House of Representatives impeached Trump over his actions on Jan. 6. Kent Nishimura\\n\\nSince leaving office, an avalanche of lawsuits against Trump have piled up, many of which are currently stalled. The former president has been charged in four criminal cases: a federal election interference case, a classified documents case, a Georgia election interference case, and a hush-money case. Trump used money from two of his PACs to pay his mountain of legal fees.\\n\\nOn May 30, 2024, Trump was convicted of 34 felony counts of falsifying business records related to hush-money payments made to Stormy Daniels, a porn star who alleges she had an affair with Trump. With the guilty verdict, Trump became the first former president to be convicted of a crime. The hush-money case sentencing has been moved until Nov. 26, after the election.\\n\\nThe other three cases are all stalled. In the federal election interference case, special prosecutor Jack Smith is accusing Trump of engaging in a broad effort to undermine Biden's 2020 win. Smith argues that Trump amplified false claims about voter fraud, pressured elected officials, and organized fake electors. A recent Supreme Court ruling derailed the case, but Smith issued a new J6 indictment in August. Legal experts have said that a trial might not start until 2026 due to the thicket of issues to resolve.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nGeorgia's election interference case focuses specifically on Trump's alleged attempts to overturn Biden's win in the state. District Attorney Fani Willis charged Trump and allies in August of 2023, but the case has shrunk in scope and a judge dismissed several counts against Trump. The case has been mired in scandals involving Willis' personal life, and is currently held up as Trump attempts to disqualify Willis as the lead prosecutor.\\n\\nSmith also led the charge on a federal case accusing Trump of storing sensitive national security documents at Mar-a-Lago after removing them from the White House, and impeding the government from retrieving the documents. A Trump-appointed judge in Florida dismissed the case over highly controversial allegations that Smith's special counsel appointment was unconstitutional. Smith's office is appealing her ruling.\\n\\nIn addition to the criminal trials, a jury found Trump guilty of sexual abuse in a civil case brought by E. Jean Carroll. The saga, which has extended over two suits, relates to Carroll's allegation that Trump raped her in a Manhattan department store and subsequently made defamatory statements. Together, they resulted in a verdict granting Carroll damages of $88.3 million. Trump has appealed the cases.\\n\\nShould Trump win the election, he will likely throw out the federal criminal cases against him.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nTrump is facing four criminal lawsuits and is the first former president to be convicted of a crime. Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images\\n\\nDonald Trump's 2024 reelection campaign and policy stances\\n\\nTrump announced his third presidential bid just after the 2022 midterms, and almost two years before election day in 2024. He easily beat his primary rivals and prepared for a rematch against Biden.\\n\\nTrump complained when Biden dropped out of the presidential race at the end of July and Vice President Kamala Harris soared to the top of the ticket. Polls show Trump and Harris remain closely tied in the race for the White House.\\n\\nTrump is running against Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election. Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images\\n\\nThe election cycle has been defined by political violence: There have been two alleged assassination attempts against Trump thus far, one in Pennsylvania and the other in Florida. The former president survived both.\\n\\nOn July 13, Thomas Matthew Crooks shot at Trump at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, nicking his ear using an AR-style rifle. A Secret Service sniper killed Crooks, whose motive for the shooting remains unclear. The first assassination attempt quickly became a rallying cry for Trump supporters, and Elon Musk endorsed the former president shortly after.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThe second apparent assassination attempt occurred on Sept. 15 in Palm Beach, Florida at a golf course. Ryan Wesley Routh, the suspect, may have staked out the course for 12 hours. Law enforcement officials said that Routh got close to Trump but didn't have a clear line of sight of the former president. They also said that a Secret Service agent spotted Routh's rifle through a fence and immediately opened fire, at which point the suspect fled. On Sept. 16, Routh was charged on two firearms counts.\\n\\nDonald Trump is rushed offstage during a rally in Pennsylvania after an attempted assassination. Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images\\n\\nDespite the many twists in the election cycle and the two candidates' wildly different politics, Harris and Trump remain virtually tied in the polls. The competition has turned nasty at times, with Trump questioning Harris' race and contending with a pattern of misogynistic comments toward female opponents.\\n\\nIn terms of the economy, a top issue for many voters, Trump has promised to extend his hallmark 2017 tax cuts and eliminate taxes on tips. He's also threatening a broad 10 to 20% tariff on imported goods, which economists predict would fuel inflation.\\n\\nTrump's views on abortion have become a sticky subject in the post-Roe environment \\u2014 he takes credit for overturning Roe v. Wade but has tempered his stance to appeal to rising pro-choice sentiment. Trump has said that states should decide the laws around abortion and hasn't publicly supported a federal ban. In August, Trump said that the federal government should pay for costly IVF treatments.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nImmigration has emerged as a key campaign issue and Trump has promised mass deportations. His team has also drafted memos to implement curb migration and implement the same hardline border policies he adopted during his first term.\\n\\nTrump has criticized Israel's actions in Gaza at times, but portrays himself as a strong defender of the Israeli state and hosted Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at Mar-a-Lago. With respect to the war in Ukraine, Trump has repeatedly said he could quickly end the Ukraine war, though hasn't specified how. He's avoided explicitly saying that he wants Ukraine to win. And on the question of China, Trump continues to take a tough tone \\u2014 he's threatened to levy a 60% tariff on Chinese goods.\\n\\nOn the campaign trail, Trump has vowed to make sure America leads the world in oil and gas production. He's also promised to cut energy and electricity prices by more than half, and roll back Biden's electric vehicle policies.\\n\\nWhether Trump regains control of the White House, the Republican party and country will continue to grapple with the MAGA movement's enduring cultural and political force.\"\n",

As a result, local governments fronting the funds to recover from older disasters can be left in a lurch.\\n\\nIn this case, for nearly two months, FEMA hoarded $9 billion to make up for delayed funding from Congress. That aid was meant for communities rebuilding from other extreme events \\u2014 like flooding in Vermont, atmospheric rivers in California, and wildfires in the Pacific Northwest. It needed to reserve those funds for lifesaving measures in the Southeast.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThis is the second year in a row that FEMA has paused long-term recovery efforts in an attempt to avoid a shortfall, despite warning Congress for months that it would need billions more ahead of hurricane season. A day before Helene hit Florida, Congress passed a law for short-term government spending that authorized $20 billion for FEMA to resume business as usual. But Biden-administration officials warn of another shortfall as soon as January, especially after Hurricane Milton slammed into the Tampa area late Wednesday.\\n\\n\\\"The agency is frequently in 'reaction mode,' waiting for Congress to approve additional funds after a disaster strikes instead of having sufficient resources ready upfront,\\\" Craig Fugate, who led FEMA during the Obama administration and now owns an emergency-management consultancy, said in an email. \\\"This can lead to gaps particularly for long-term recovery needs.\\\"\\n\\nRelated stories\\n\\n'Immediate needs' only\\n\\nThe ad hoc way the US funds disaster relief slows down state and local efforts to rebuild before the next crisis and makes the process more expensive, emergency-response experts and community advocates said.\\n\\nPart of the problem is that FEMA doesn't ask Congress for enough money at the start of the year, said Carlos Mart\\u00edn, who studies disaster mitigation, recovery, and adapting housing to climate change at Harvard University. The agency's request is based on a 10-year rolling average of the past, which doesn't account for the growing risks of climate-fueled disasters.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\\"Anybody who's in the climate-change world knows that isn't going to work anymore,\\\" Mart\\u00edn said. \\\"Not only are these disasters much more severe and more frequent, but they're affecting highly urbanized places.\\\"\\n\\nFEMA often requests additional disaster-relief funds from Congress throughout the year. However, those requests aren't guaranteed to be approved, especially as lawmakers struggle to pass even basic government-spending deals. Sometimes the delays push FEMA's budget into \\\"immediate-needs funding,\\\" which ensures the agency can execute search-and-rescue operations, remove debris, and provide food, water, and shelter to displaced survivors immediately after the next catastrophe.\\n\\nIn this mode, funding is suspended for state and local governments rebuilding infrastructure damaged by disasters in the past decade, or more in some cases. Since 2001, immediate-needs funding has been invoked nine times, most recently in 2017, 2023, and 2024 in the wake of hurricanes. In the meantime, local governments that took out loans to fund recovery efforts must wait to get reimbursed by FEMA, said Yucel Ors, the legislative director of public safety and crime prevention at the National League of Cities.\\n\\n\\\"Those loans have interest,\\\" he said. \\\"So if FEMA delays reimbursements, local governments have to bear those costs, and they may put off recovery efforts. If they put off recovery efforts, that will impact the economy.\\\"\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nDuring a call with reporters on Monday, a FEMA official said that the agency works closely with the White House to estimate the funding it needs each year and for months had asked Congress for more. The official said they're \\\"confident\\\" the agency would get the resources needed to help survivors recover.\\n\\nFEMA first requested additional funding in October 2023. President Joe Biden in a letter to lawmakers on Friday suggested they return to Washington from the campaign trail to pass extra relief, especially with the Small Business Administration's disaster-loan program also low on funding. But House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican from Louisiana, told \\\"Fox News Sunday\\\" that Congress would be back in session after the November election to \\\"do its job\\\" and accused FEMA of not being prepared for Hurricane Helene.\\n\\n\\\"The thing about these hurricanes and disasters of this magnitude is it takes awhile to calculate the actual damages, and the states are going to need some time to do that,\\\" Johnson said. \\\"You don't just send estimates to the federal government. You send specific needs and requests based upon the actual damages.\\\"\\n\\nFEMA officials have repeatedly said they have enough resources to respond to Hurricane Helene and now Hurricane Milton but declined to specify how much disaster aid remained available. They set up a fact-checking page to debunk misinformation about the agency's relief work and encourage survivors to continue signing up for assistance.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nMore than 7,400 federal workers \\u2014 including 1,500 from FEMA \\u2014 continue to support North Carolina, Georgia, South Carolina, Florida, Tennessee, and Virginia, the agency said. Assistance to Helene survivors surpassed $286 million.

This new advertising business looks to help marketers tap into data on the billions of transactions that take place across its payments platforms.\\n\\nStarting this year, brands and agencies in the US will be able to run ads across properties, including PayPal, the person-to-person payment service Venmo, and Honey, its coupon and cash-back tool.\\n\\nNext year, PayPal also intends to let these advertisers purchase ads across the more than 30 million merchants that use its payment systems, opening up a much broader commerce-media ad network.\\n\\nMark Grether, the senior vice president and general manager of PayPal Ads, who joined the company this year after leading Uber's now-$1 billion ad business, will make the announcement later on Thursday at the Advertising Week New York trade show.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nIn an interview with Business Insider, Grether said the company was looking to address a key pain point in the fast-growing retail-media-ad space. An avalanche of retailers, apps, and businesses have launched advertising businesses in recent months, but marketers typically can't buy campaigns across multiple sites and instead must deal with each company individually.\\n\\n\\\"With our cross-merchant data, we are in a prime position to help the market to rationalize,\\\" Grether said.\\n\\nAbout $1 in every $7 US ad dollars is expected to be devoted to the retail-media space this year, according to Emarketer. Advertisers are particularly attracted to the space because they can get in front of consumers just as they're about to make a purchase, and retailers can offer unique data about whether their advertising led to a sale. That means it's a high-margin business for the sellers of retail-media ads because they can charge higher rates than the average web-display ad.\\n\\n\\\"The newest offering from PayPal underscores the importance of incrementality: While data and signals tied to consumer purchasing are not necessarily new, the opportunity to infuse incremental moments of influence throughout shoppers' journeys opens up real-time engagement for advertisers,\\\" said JiYoung Kim, the chief operating officer for North America at the media-investment company GroupM.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nPayPal had 429 million active accounts as of June 30, a larger potential audience than most individual retailers \\u2014 bar the likes of Amazon and Walmart, which are the leaders in the retail-media space.\\n\\nGrether said PayPal would also be able to offer advertisers insights, such as the market share of their products across various retailers compared with their competitors.\\n\\nRelated stories\\n\\n\\\"It's really powerful not only for the CMO but also for the CFO to see how a retail-marketing campaign actually influences market share,\\\" Grether said.\\n\\nUsers can opt out of their data being shared with advertisers, PayPal said.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nPayPal's other plans for next year include expanding from display ads to video, working on self-service ad software for its clients, and offering PayPal Ads in more territories, such as the UK and Germany. PayPal said the current ad stack was built using a mixture of third-party software and its in-house tech.\\n\\nIt made its foray into ads earlier this year, launching nontargeted in-app offers from brands like Nordstrom, Lyft, and Ticketmaster. It's also recently launched a marketing push that aims to position PayPal and Venmo as rewarding payment methods.\\n\\nPayPal's advertising expansion follows the company's appointment of CEO Alex Chriss, who has sought to make the company nimbler. Under Chriss, PayPal overhauled its leadership team, including hiring a former Verizon chief marketing officer, Diego Scotti, whom Grether reports to.\\n\\nRobert Webster, the founder of the consultancy TAU Marketing Solutions, said PayPal's transaction data put the company in a prime position to launch an advertising service. But he said it would need to tread carefully to avoid alienating and bombarding customers. Plus, it's launching late into an already-crowded market.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\\"Mastercard already has a data business,\\\" Webster said. \\\"They will be somewhat also competing with other data vendors like Lotame, Dun & Bradstreet, Experian, as well as potentially competing with retail-media networks.\\\"\"\n",

      "            \"text\": \"The moment I saw I had an email from my solar company, I knew my nightmare was about to take another unsettling turn.\\n\\nFor weeks, I'd been wrangling with my solar dealer about the panels it had installed on my roof months earlier. I'd passed all the necessary inspections. Someone just needed to flip a switch and turn them on, and my family would finally start saving about $400 a month in electricity during the blistering summers here in Fresno, California. But Sun Solar, the redundantly named dealer, kept giving me the runaround. I nagged them so much that I eventually got a call from a supervisor who told me the company couldn't turn the panels on until it had approval from its partner, SunPower.\\n\\nAnd that email from SunPower finally confirmed my suspicions: The company, one of the biggest solar providers in the country, announced it was filing for bankruptcy protection.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nI was furious. I frantically called back Sun Solar, demanding answers. The sales rep was empathetic and candid. He, too, had a lot of questions for SunPower \\u2014 what did its going under mean for his business? But he didn't know any more than I did about how much longer my solar panels would remain useless.\\n\\nI hung up, dejected. Then I went through a tailspin of self-doubt. Why had I become a homeowner in the first place? Our apartment in New York City was tiny, but if anything happened, all I had to do was call my super. Also, how could I have missed that this company was in trouble? I'm a business journalist, after all, and I thought I'd done my research on SunPower. It was one of the oldest and most respected companies in residential solar still in operation.\\n\\nBut after digging a bit further, I quickly learned that SunPower was far from alone. At a time when solar is most needed to stave off the climate crisis, much of the industry is cooling. Over the past few years, high interest rates have decimated demand for residential solar, resulting in layoffs (more than 17,000 in 2023 among California solar companies alone), questionable financial engineering that's been compared to the subprime-lending crisis that sparked the Great Recession, and many, many bankruptcies \\u2014 more than 100 across America so far this year.\\n\\nMeanwhile, my solar panels have been sitting on my roof for four months, entirely unused, taunting me from above. Over another summer of record-breaking heat, my electricity bills were astronomical. As it's only getting hotter, the solar industry threatens to leave us in the dark.\\n\\nCalifornia's Central Valley is prime solar-power country. There's rarely a rainy day here and ample sunlight for solar panels to take in and convert to electricity. It's rare to see a house here without solar panels. But there are a few, and mine was one of them. Solar companies knew that.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nEarlier this year, I'd get calls every day from solar companies eager to pitch me on getting a system installed on my house. Sales reps from companies like Sunrun would also frequently knock on my door, asking whether I would consider solar. It happened so much that my wife and I decided to post a \\\"no soliciting\\\" sign out front.\\n\\nBut in the end, all that nagging worked \\u2014 I was sold on the potential for savings. Getting electricity from my provider, Pacific Gas and Electric, one of the three main providers in the state, is staggeringly expensive. Since 2020, PG&E's residential-electricity rates have risen 38% after you adjust for inflation, Severin Borenstein, a professor at Berkeley's Haas School of Business, wrote in a blog post. In the past 15 months alone, PG&E has hiked its rates four times. During previous summers, when daily highs averaged over 100 degrees for weeks on end, several of my neighbors' monthly electricity bills reached nearly $1,000 \\u2014 close to the average monthly rent in Fresno. I did not want that.\\n\\nRelated stories\\n\\nNeither do many homeowners across America. From 2015 to 2022, residential solar installations climbed by an average of 15% a year. Some can afford to buy an entire solar system, which costs about $12,500 on average, or finance it with a loan. Often, though, homeowners enter into arrangements like power purchase agreements, in which there are no up-front costs. The company goes out and finds capital to fund the project, installs the system, and then charges a monthly rate over a 20- or 25-year lease. Over the past five years, nearly one-quarter of homeowners in California who have had solar panels installed have gone with that agreement \\u2014 including me. After I called Sun Solar in March, the SunPower dealer, my solar project was in motion within a week.\\n\\nBut as my project progressed, I missed several signs that SunPower, along with much of the solar industry, was in a downward spiral. The company lost $200 million in 2023, and 2024 was shaping up to be worse. In the months since I called Sun Solar, had my panels installed, and waited, and waited, for an update, SunPower received notice from Nasdaq that it was out of compliance for not filing forms on time, its accounting firm, Ernst & Young, resigned, and its stock cratered to less than $0.70 a share.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nGordon Johnson, the founder and CEO of the equity-research firm GLJ Research, said the solar-panel systems offered by companies like SunPower and its main rivals, Sunnova and Sunrun, rarely make any money for the companies. \\\"Solar is extremely uneconomical,\\\" he said.\\n\\nPart of what makes solar attractive is the 30% federal tax credit. Homeowners are eligible for it if they buy the panels themselves. If they opt for a power purchase agreement, the solar company can claim a similar credit \\u2014 a practice that has recently come under scrutiny. Johnson said many solar companies use questionable accounting practices to inflate the value of solar systems and get larger government tax credits, which they then go shop on the open market and sell to companies such as Alphabet and Meta.\\n\\n\\\"This industry is rife with fraud,\\\" Johnson said.\\n\\nStock analysts aren't the only ones calling the residential-solar model into question. Late last year, Forbes said an industry whistleblower had reported to the IRS that bloated tax-credit claims were widespread across the residential-solar space. In August, the Stanford professor David F. Larcker and Brian Tayan, a corporate-governance researcher at the school, published an alarming analysis titled \\\"Solar Flare Up: Systemic Organizational Risk in the Residential Solar Industry.\\\" The authors said a cocktail of convoluted financing, tax credits, high sales commissions, and uncertain costs \\\"have combined to create an incredibly complex industry with multiple points of potential breakdown.\\\" They cited the recent bankruptcies of the solar giants Titan Solar, iSun, SunPower, and various others \\\"due to financial distress, changes in regulatory standards, or fraud\\\" as harbingers for a wider collapse. The insurer Solar Insure says nearly 75% of solar installers in California are at a \\\"high risk\\\" of shutting down.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nSome, however, remain optimistic about residential solar's long-term prospects. \\\"The fact that SunPower went bankrupt was largely self-inflicted,\\\" Pavel Molchanov, a managing director at Raymond James, said. \\\"There are plenty of other companies who do rooftop solar in this country that are alive and well.\\\" He pointed out that the cost of electricity from utility providers is only going to go up \\u2014 the national average cost increased 11% in 2022 and 6% in 2023 \\u2014 and the cost of solar equipment has become cheaper, making solar electricity an attractive option for consumers. There's also still a huge market since 95% of single-family US homes don't have solar.\\n\\nBut among the 5% of us who do, many of us remain in purgatory, awaiting our troubled corporate sun gods to decide our fate.\\n\\nRelated stories\\n\\nA few days after my deflating call with the Sun Solar sales rep, I heard from the company's vice president of sales. While he was empathetic, he made clear that there wasn't much I could do: SunPower had communicated to the company that it couldn't touch the panels on my roof, which meant I was stuck with a lifeless solar system and couldn't seek out alternatives. A couple of days later, he called me back with a couple of options: I could buy the system outright in cash, for just over $54,000 \\u2014 $38,000 with the tax credit \\u2014 or finance it.\\n\\nIn response to a detailed list of questions I asked for this story, SunPower directed me to the same press release announcing it was filing for bankruptcy protection that it had sent me as a customer, adding that it would provide updates when they became available. The dealer, Sun Solar, did not respond to these questions, either.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nI also reached out to California's Contractors State License Board, which regulates solar companies, asking what recourse SunPower's customers had. In an emailed statement, it said the board had \\\"identified substantial violations or concerns related to SunPower's operations\\\" and \\\"initiated formal disciplinary proceedings\\\" to revoke the company's contractor license. It added that it had received complaints about SunPower. It has forwarded the case to the state's attorney general's office. For customers, the board recommends they consult with an attorney.\\n\\nI still haven't decided what I'll do. But it seems ludicrous to buy a solar system that I had no intention of buying in the first place. And with the state of residential solar in limbo, it's an option I have serious doubts about.\\n\\nI'm reminded of this ordeal every day I return to my house and see the gleaming, useless solar panel ornaments adorning my roof. It feels like I'm trapped in a dark comedy sitcom depicting life as a millennial homeowner. Then, like a bad punchline, I pull into the garage and turn on the lights.\\n\\nVishal Persaud is the senior editor on the venture capital and startups team at Business Insider, covering the venture-capital industry and the startups it invests in.\"\n",

      "            \"text\": \"Ratan Tata, the businessman who inherited one of India\\u2019s oldest conglomerates and transformed it through a string of eye-catching deals into a global empire, has died. He was 86.\\n\\nHis death was announced in a statement by Tata Group Chairman Natarajan Chandrasekaran, who called Tata \\u201ca truly uncommon leader whose immeasurable contributions have shaped not only the Tata Group but also the very fabric of our nation.\\u201d\\n\\nAs chairman for more than two decades beginning in 1991, Tata rapidly expanded the 156-year-old business house. It now has operations in more than 100 countries and clocked $165 billion in revenue for the year ended March 2024.\\n\\nThrough more than two dozen listed firms, the conglomerate makes products ranging from coffee and cars to salt and software, runs airlines and introduced India\\u2019s first superapp. It has also partnered with Taiwan\\u2019s Powerchip Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp. for a $11 billion chip fabrication plant in India and is said to be planning an iPhone assembly plant.\\n\\nUnder Tata\\u2019s stewardship, the conglomerate embarked on an expansion drive that turned the tables on India\\u2019s colonial past. It snapped up iconic British assets including steelmaker Corus Group Plc. in 2007 and luxury carmaker Jaguar Land Rover in 2008. But the financial crisis roiled global markets soon after, damping car sales in developed economies.\\n\\n\\u201cRatan Tata imagined big and took the empire beyond India,\\u201d said Kavil Ramachandran, executive director of the Thomas Schmidheiny Center for Family Enterprise at the Indian School of Business in Hyderabad. \\u201cWhile he thought globally, these turned out to be hasty initiatives.\\u201d\\n\\nTata helmed the group for 21 years in his first stint and retired in 2012. He returned as interim chief for a few months in 2016 following the acrimonious ouster of his successor, Cyrus Mistry.\\n\\nTata also found himself at the center of intense battles for control of the conglomerate not once but twice in his career.\\n\\nThe first battle, when he took over as chairman in 1991, pitted him against long-time executives who had been running fiefdoms within the conglomerate under his predecessor. The second, in 2016\\u2014four years after his retirement\\u2014was about preserving his legacy as Mistry sought to reduce debt.\\n\\nTata won both. In 2016, Mistry was ousted as the chairman of Tata Sons, the group\\u2019s main holding firm, in a boardroom coup. The move triggered a bitter courtroom battle that threatened to end a 70-year partnership with Mistry\\u2019s family and stamped Tata\\u2019s authority on the conglomerate. In 2020, Mistry\\u2019s family signaled its intent to sell an 18% stake in Tata Sons.\\n\\nTerrorist Attack\\n\\nThe conglomerate faced another crisis in late 2008 when terrorists targeted the group\\u2019s flagship hotel, the Taj Mahal Palace, overlooking Mumbai\\u2019s Gateway of India, part of a broader attack on the city. About 31 people, including 11 employees, died during the four-day siege. Guests staying at the hotel today are greeted by a memorial with the names of the victims, each of whose families Tata personally visited.\\n\\nTata never married and had no children. His death leaves a vacuum at the helm of the powerful Tata Trusts, a collective of charities. These philanthropic trusts own about 66% of Tata Sons, which in turn controls all the major listed Tata firms. Tata Trusts have traditionally been led by a member of the Tata family and wields control over the conglomerate through its holding in Tata Sons.\\n\\nIn his last few years, Tata became a passionate backer of startups including Ola Electric Mobility Ltd., which had a bumper listing in 2024, and Goodfellows, a platform aimed at intergenerational friendships.\\n\\nThe origins of the Tata group date back to 1868, when Jamsetji Nusserwanji Tata set up a trading company that later diversified into cotton mills, steel plants and hotels. The Tatas belong to the Parsi Zoroastrian community, which fled religious persecution in Persia centuries ago before finding refuge in western India.\\n\\nParents Divorced\\n\\nBorn in Mumbai on Dec. 28, 1937, Ratan Naval Tata was brought up by his grandmother after his parents, Naval and Sooni Tata, divorced when he was 10. His father had been adopted into the main Tata family at 13 by the daughter-in-law of Jamsetji Tata, founder of the Tata Group.\\n\\nUsually chauffeured around in a Rolls-Royce, Tata attended school in India\\u2019s business capital, Mumbai. As a young student, he learned the piano and played cricket but was afraid of public speaking. His younger brother, Jimmy Tata, stayed out of public life, and little is known about him.\\n\\n\\u201cWe faced a fair bit of ragging and personal discomfort because of our parent\\u2019s divorce, which in those days wasn\\u2019t as common as it is today,\\u201d Ratan Tata wrote in a Facebook post in 2020. \\u201cBut our grandmother taught us to retain dignity at all costs, a value that\\u2019s stayed with me until today. It involved walking away from these situations, which otherwise we would have fought back against.\\u201d\\n\\nTata went to college in the US at Cornell University with plans to study mechanical engineering, as his father wished, but he found his calling elsewhere.\\n\\n\\u201cI had always wanted to be an architect, and at the end of my second year at Cornell, I switched\\u2014much to my father\\u2019s consternation and upset,\\u201d Tata recalled in a 2009 interview with Cornell. He graduated in 1962 with a degree in architecture.\\n\\nIBM Offer\\n\\nTata wanted to settle down in California, but the poor health of his grandmother prompted him to return to India, where he had a job offer from International Business Machines Corp.\\n\\nThe then-chairman of Tata Sons, Jehangir Ratanji Dadabhoy Tata, popularly known as JRD, persuaded him to instead work for the group. The two men were distantly related, parts of different branches of the Tata family tree. Groomed by JRD, the younger Tata started his career at the conglomerate in 1962, undertaking several stints at various units before joining management in the 1970s.\\n\\nIn 1991, when Tata was handpicked for the top job at Tata Sons, the group was mostly focused on India. Tata Consultancy Services Ltd., the software maker that would become a cash cow years later, was still in its infancy. The automotive business hadn\\u2019t yet started making passenger cars.\\n\\nThe 1990s was also the decade when India started cutting its notorious red tape, discarding parts of a failed Soviet-style planned economy. That meant private sector companies could compete more effectively in sectors that were dominated by government enterprises, paving the way for faster economic growth and unleashing consumption.\\n\\nAs India allowed foreign automakers from Ford Motor Co. to [hotlink]Hyundai Motor[/hotlink] Co. to set up factories and tap burgeoning consumer demand, Tata decided to make cars as well. Tata called the first locally built passenger vehicle\\u2014rolled out in 1998 and named Indica\\u2014\\u201cmy baby.\\u201d\\n\\nAs India\\u2019s economy started to boom in the 2000s, Tata became more adventurous. In 2007, he took on debt to pay about $13 billion for Corus, the British steelmaker. The following year, he acquired Jaguar Land Rover, or JLR, from Ford for $2.3 billion. He also bought Tetley Group Plc and the heavy-vehicles unit of South Korea\\u2019s Daewoo group.\\n\\nNew Challenges\\n\\nWhile the acquisition spree helped bring the conglomerate\\u2019s geographical footprint to an entirely new level, it also set up a number of challenges.\\n\\nThe 2008 financial crisis triggered a broad slide in commodity prices, while a steel glut fueled by an increase in Chinese exports depressed prices, sparking criticism that Tata had overpaid to acquire Corus. Tata Steel Ltd. has pared its European operations in recent years in the face of slumping demand and high cost structures, and slashed thousands of jobs in the continent.\\n\\nJLR also hit a rough patch soon after it was acquired by Tata as the financial crisis pummeled demand for luxury cars as well as the company\\u2019s ability to access credit. While the Tata Group managed to turn around the marquee car brand within a couple of years, it soon faced other headwinds, from slumping Chinese demand to Brexit. The pandemic and chips shortage affected JLR in recent years.\\n\\nTata oversaw another auto-related setback with the failure of the Nano microcar. He wanted to build a cheap automobile that would retail for 100,000 rupees ($1,190.9), targeted at the millions of Indians who typically used motorcycles to get around and transport their families. Production of the Nano was ended in 2018, about 10 years after its unveiling, amid a lack of demand due to early quality and safety concerns.\\n\\nPerhaps the final business battle Tata fought was his most gratifying.\\n\\nIn 2021, Tata Sons regained control of Air India Ltd., the nation\\u2019s flagship carrier, almost 90 years after it was taken over by the state. Heavily indebted and a shadow of its former glory\\u2014Salvador Dali once designed ashtrays as gifts for the airline\\u2019s guests\\u2014 the deal meant Tata was able to welcome home to the group an airline originally founded by his mentor, JRD.\"\n",

Measured from month to month, prices increased 0.2% from August to September, the Labor Department reported Thursday, the same as in the previous month.\\n\\nBut excluding volatile food and energy costs, \\u201ccore\\u201d prices, a gauge of underlying inflation, remained elevated in September, driven up by rising costs for medical care, clothing, auto insurance and airline fares. Core prices in September were up 3.3% from a year earlier and 0.3% from August. Economists closely watch core prices, which typically provide a better hint of future inflation.\\n\\nAlan Detmeister, an economist at UBS Investment Bank, suggested that some items that contributed to higher core inflation last month, notably used cars, may rise again in the coming months, keeping prices a bit elevated. But other items that rose in price in September, like clothing and air fares, are more volatile and should cool soon.\\n\\n\\u201cThings are still gradually coming down, but there is going to be volatility month to month,\\u201d said Detmeister, a former Federal Reserve economist.\\n\\nTaken as a whole, the September figures show that inflation is steadily easing back to the Fed\\u2019s 2% target, even if in an uneven pattern. That decline suggests that the Fed will likely keep cutting its benchmark interest rate this year, with two quarter-point reductions in November and December expected by most economists.\\n\\nOn a positive note, apartment rental prices grew more slowly last month, a sign that housing inflation is finally cooling, a long-awaited development that would provide relief to many consumers.\\n\\nOmair Sharif, founder of Inflation Insights, said that measures of new rents show a steady slowdown, suggesting that the government\\u2019s gauges of rent should continue to ease over time.\\n\\n\\u201cI think we\\u2019re on the right path here,\\u201d Sharif said. \\u201cWe should see rent cool off quite a bit.\\u201d\\n\\nOverall inflation last month was held down by a big drop in gas prices, which fell 4.1% from August to September. Grocery prices jumped 0.4% last month, after roughly a year of mild increases, though they\\u2019re just 1.3% higher than a year earlier.\\n\\nStill, food prices have risen nearly 25% from pre-pandemic levels, which has hammered many Americans\\u2019 budgets and taken on a high profile in the presidential campaign. Trump has often cited the cost of bacon, which soared 30% to a peak of $7.60 a pound in October 2022, as an example of big increases in the cost of living. Bacon prices have since fallen to $6.95 but are still elevated.\\n\\nRestaurant food prices increased 0.3% last month and are up 3.9% in the past year. And clothing prices rose 1.1% from August to September and are up 1.8% from a year ago.\\n\\nBryan Tublin, co-founder of Kitava, a casual farm-to-table restaurant in San Francisco, said he has struggled mightily with rising prices for produce, meats and oils for the past three years. Though some of those prices have started to slow, he said, many farmers are still passing on to him their higher costs for things like shipping and labor.\\n\\nIn response, Tublin said, he has changed suppliers in search of cheaper products, substituting a local wild-rice blend for cauliflower rice when cauliflower prices shot higher.\\n\\nKitava also started charging extra for beef and other proteins at its two locations.\\n\\n\\u201cI am starting to see signs that our prices are leveling out and the increases are lessening,\\u201d Tublin said. \\u201cThere\\u2019s a little optimism\\u2026 but it\\u2019s still very early days.\\u201d\\n\\nThe improving inflation picture follows a mostly healthy jobs report released last week, which showed that hiring accelerated in September and that the unemployment rate dropped from 4.2% to 4.1%. The government has also reported that the economy expanded at a solid 3% annual rate in the April-June quarter. Growth likely continued at roughly that pace in the just-completed July-September quarter.\\n\\nCooling inflation, solid hiring and healthy growth could erode former President Donald Trump\\u2019s advantage on the economy in the presidential campaign as measured by public opinion polls. In some surveys, Vice President Kamala Harris has pulled even with Trump on the issue of who would best handle the economy, after Trump had decisively led President Joe Biden on the issue.\\n\\nAt the same time, most voters still give the economy relatively poor marks, mostly because of the cumulative rise in prices over the past three years.\\n\\nFor the Fed, last week\\u2019s much-stronger-than-expected jobs report fueled some concern that the economy might not be cooling enough to slow inflation sufficiently. The central bank reduced its key rate by an outsized half-point last month, its first rate cut of any size in four years. The Fed\\u2019s policymakers also signaled that they envisioned two additional quarter-point rate cuts in November and December.\\n\\nIn remarks this week, a slew of Fed officials have said they\\u2019re still willing to keep cutting their key rate but at a deliberate pace, a signal that any further half-point cuts are unlikely.\\n\\nThe Fed \\u201cshould not rush to reduce\\u201d its benchmark rate \\u201cbut rather should proceed gradually,\\u201d Lorie Logan president of the Federal Reserve\\u2019s Dallas branch, said in a speech Wednesday.\\n\\nInflation in the United States and many countries in Europe and Latin America surged in the economic recovery from the pandemic, as COVID closed factories and clogged supply chains. Russia\\u2019s invasion of Ukraine worsened energy and food shortages, pushing inflation higher. It peaked at 9.1% in the U.S. in June 2022.\\n\\nEconomists at Goldman Sachs projected earlier this week that core inflation will drop to 3% by December 2024. And few analysts expect inflation to surge again unless conflicts in the Middle East worsen dramatically.\\n\\nThough higher prices have soured many Americans on the economy, wages and incomes are now rising faster than costs and should make it easier for households to adapt. Last month, the Census Bureau reported that inflation-adjusted median household incomes \\u2014 the level at which half of households are above and half below \\u2014 rose 4% in 2023, enough to return incomes back to their pre-pandemic peak.\\n\\nAnd on Thursday, the Social Security Administration announced that nearly 73 million recipients of Social Security and other benefits will receive a 2.5% cost of living adjustment in January. That is down from a 3.2% increase in 2024 and an outsize 8.7% jump the previous year, reflecting an inflation surge that has since subsided.\"\n",

      "            \"text\": \"Europe\\u2019s ambitions to lead the world in green technologies risk fizzling out in the face of China\\u2019s dominance. The outlook is especially bleak when it comes to electric vehicle batteries, an important driver of the low-carbon economy.\\n\\nSweden\\u2019s Northvolt AB was long seen as a potential European rival to the giant Chinese companies that make most of the world\\u2019s electric vehicle power cells. Now the business is fighting for its survival after a series of operational blunders wrecked its growth plans.\\n\\nHow did Northvolt\\u2019s plans unravel?\\n\\nIf it was going to have a chance of competing with Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. and other Chinese battery giants, Northvolt needed to grow fast.\\n\\nThe company amassed billions of dollars in debt and equity, secured using $55 billion of contracts from some of Europe\\u2019s biggest car and truck makers. In early 2022, before its first site in Sweden had even begun commercial production, Northvolt managers were already planning a new factory in Germany. A further plant in Canada was announced the following year.\\n\\nMaking this high-stakes strategy pay off would require flawless execution. Instead, the flagship Swedish factory was plagued by operational setbacks and challenges in trying to ramp up production while keeping a lid on costs.\\n\\nAfter selling its first battery cells in 2022, Northvolt\\u2019s losses tripled in 2023 to $1.03 billion. The company tried to woo investors that year with plans for a stock-market listing at a $20 billion valuation. But its growth strategy was already coming apart.\\n\\nThis year, to stave off a financing crunch, Northvolt announced a retrenchment, scrapping two cathode material production facilities in Sweden, shuttering a research and development subsidiary in California and seeking out new investors for a project in Poland.\\n\\nThis wasn\\u2019t enough to reassure its investors. Two weeks later, the company said it was laying off 20% of its workforce \\u2014 affecting 1,600 employees in Sweden \\u2014 and further scaling back R&D. It also cut into its core, revenue-generating business by pausing an expansion at the flagship Swedish plant and sending that unit into bankruptcy. The German and Canadian plants also face delays.\\n\\nHow did it go so wrong?\\n\\nThe decision to grow aggressively in a range of battery technologies threw up a breathtaking number of operational hurdles. The plans encompassed not just a rapid scale-up of complex cell manufacturing, but the production of components such as cathode materials, the construction of new factories and a joint-venture with carmaker Volvo Car AB. Northvolt was even developing lithium-metal batteries for electric aircraft.\\n\\nBad luck played a part: There were reports of problems with machinery imported from China. And by moving so fast, the company appears to have compromised on quality, leading to a high number of faulty cells that couldn\\u2019t be used. In June, BMW AG canceled a \\u20ac2 billion ($2.2 billion) order due to quality problems. Volkswagen AG\\u2019s truckmaking arm, Scania CV AB, complained about slow deliveries from Northvolt at the start of 2024.\\n\\nNorthvolt has also faced a string of health and safety issues, including worker injuries and reports of toxic chemical leaks.\\n\\nAre Northvolt\\u2019s managers entirely at fault?\\n\\nWhile this was arguably a crisis of Northvolt\\u2019s own making, Chief Executive Officer Peter Carlsson has blamed the state of the wider industry.\\n\\nThere\\u2019s certainly global overcapacity in the sector: Companies have announced $1.1 trillion in investments in battery cell and component production between 2024 and 2030, analysts at BloombergNEF said in June. That\\u2019s more than four times the $242 billion needed to meet expected demand.\\n\\nThe mismatch signals a prolonged period of low prices that will favor suppliers with the lowest cost base. The excess of manufacturing capacity is driving record-low prices in the Chinese domestic market, where lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery cells can be bought for close half the average global price of $95 per kilowatt hour. There\\u2019s also a supply glut in battery materials.\\n\\nWhy is Northvolt so important for European industrial policy?\\n\\nThe European Union\\u2019s Net Zero Industry Act aims for the region to be producing 550 GWh of batteries by 2030, up from 110 GWh in 2023.\\n\\nNorthvolt isn\\u2019t the only battery producer in Europe. South Korean and Chinese companies also have factories to serve European assembly plants being retooled to make EVs. But European leaders have made clear they want the region to be a hub for clean technologies, not a manufacturing outpost for companies that repatriate the profits to Seoul and Shanghai.\\n\\nNorthvolt has been their best shot at building a big, thriving EV battery business headquartered in Europe.\\n\\nWere the company to fail, ongoing progress in battery technology could make it even harder for another European company to attempt the same feat. China\\u2019s CATL employs 21,000 engineers in R&D alone \\u2014 a figure three times greater than Northvolt\\u2019s entire workforce.\\n\\nChina supplies about 80% of the world\\u2019s lithium-ion batteries, and is home to six of the world\\u2019s 10 largest EV battery makers, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. Chinese companies are even more dominant in battery components, such as cathodes, anodes, separators and electrolytes.\\n\\nAnd China isn\\u2019t Europe\\u2019s only problem: The US, Canada, Japan, South Korea, India and Indonesia are also looking to lure investments to develop their battery industries.\\n\\nWhat about other European EV battery makers?\\n\\nIt\\u2019s not Northvolt alone that is struggling. The entire industry faces a delicate moment after governments began to scale back the financial incentives they doled out to encourage drivers to buy their first EV.\\n\\nAs a result, EV sales growth is slowing and the auto industry is having second thoughts about some of the investment plans predicated on a rapid shift to electric.\\n\\nUK battery startup Britishvolt Ltd. fell into administration in 2023 before it could open a planned \\u00a33.8 billion ($5.1 billion) site. Italy recently cut funding for a battery-plant project backed by Stellantis NV and Mercedes-Benz Group AG due to the recent softening of EV demand.\\n\\nIf Northvolt can\\u2019t turn it around, EU governments would come under pressure to effectively admit defeat and open the door for Chinese players to establish more factories in Europe in order to keep the region\\u2019s EV transition alive.\"\n",

      "            \"text\": \"Daragh Murphy knows how to milk a cow.\\n\\nAs a kid in Ireland, he spent summers on his grandparents\\u2019 dairy farm. Lots of life has since elapsed for Murphy, but it\\u2019s still his icebreaker-fun fact.\\n\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s awesome and weird to say out loud,\\u201d he said, careful when asked about how it actually works. \\u201cThe hardest thing about milking a cow is dodging excrements that may come from the cow. You\\u2019re in a pit, you basically get this machine, and\\u2026I\\u2019m getting too graphic.\\u201d\\n\\nIt\\u2019s an unlikely beginning but a telling one, suggesting that Murphy is someone who makes the most out of difficult, strange things. In his late teens and 20s, Murphy went from small town Ireland to Dublin to Chicago, eventually becoming a Duke-educated corporate lawyer in New York. During the pandemic, he met Gaurav Ahuja, then a partner at Thrive Capital, and the two took socially distanced walks in Washington Square Park, talking about fintech. The result of those talks: Imprint, a startup looking to disrupt the co-branded credit card space, which the two founded in 2020.\\n\\nFour years later, Imprint has come a long way, and is gearing up to go even further. The startup has raised a $75 million Series C, Fortune has exclusively learned. The Series C was led by Keith Rabois of Khosla Ventures, and was joined by existing investors Thrive Capital, Kleiner Perkins, and Ribbit Capital. This funding round brings Imprint\\u2019s total capital raised to $225 million, and represents a massive valuation bump\\u2014at its Series B, Imprint was valued at $240 million. Today, the startup officially boasts a valuation of $600 million.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s an impressive ascent, especially given the tough couple of years that fintech as a space has had\\u2014and the high barriers to entry in co-branded credit cards. For the uninitiated, co-branded cards are issued in a partnership between a bank and a brand. They can, generally, be used anywhere and offer perks like extra shopping rewards or purchase protection. And because dealing with credit cards is capital-intensive (Imprint took on a $300 million credit facility with Citibank earlier this year) and highly regulated, it\\u2019s a tough but colossal market.\\n\\n\\u201cThe U.S. has the biggest GDP of any country on Earth, and 70% of the U.S. GDP is from consumer spending,\\u201d Murphy said. \\u201cConsumerism is America, effectively. If you can give credit to people, you can give them rewards, and you give them a better product\\u2014the market is there and it takes care of itself.\\u201d\\n\\nThere are advantages to the co-branded space, but winning over big customers is vital to Imprint\\u2019s success moving forward. It\\u2019s a competitive space, with large players in the form of traditional banks, from Chase to Citi, and other companies like Synchrony and Bread Financial.\\n\\n\\u201cThere\\u2019s almost no market bigger,\\u201d said Nick Huber, previously at Ribbit Capital. \\u201cI think unsecured consumer credit is a trillion-dollar market in the U.S. So, if you look at the co-branded space, I\\u2019ve heard estimates that range anywhere from one-quarter to one-third of the market is in the co-brand space, so the size of the prize is just gigantic here.\\u201d\\n\\nAnd while we don\\u2019t spend too much time on it, Murphy briefly acknowledges that he\\u2019s part of a lineage of sorts, as an Irish fintech founder. (Stripe is also an investor in Imprint.) There are headlines from earlier this year touting Imprint as \\u201cthe next Irish unicorn,\\u201d so it\\u2019s an ambitious lineage, and one beset with expectations that Murphy seems prepared to meet. (Thrive partner Nabil Mallick said via email that \\u201clots of people try to run through walls, but Daragh does time and time again.\\u201d) A few times in our conversation, Murphy nods to the idea of someday going public, so I ask him: Is an IPO on the table in the near-term?\\n\\n\\u201cI\\u2019d think about it a different way,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI\\u2019m not a huge American football fan, but someone once gave me Bill Walsh\\u2019s book and it\\u2019s awesome. He has this concept of \\u2018the score will take care of itself.\\u2019 The whole thing effectively is that, if you do a good job Monday through Sunday with good training and good values, if you turn up and do the work, you don\\u2019t have to worry about the score\\u2026That\\u2019s certainly true for us.\\u201d\\n\\nImprint\\u2019s making headway. The startup\\u2019s customers currently include Turkish Airlines, Holiday Inn Hotels, retailers Eddie Bauer and Brooks Brothers, and Texas-based grocery chain HEB. But Murphy remains very well-aware of where he started. When talking about scaling Imprint, he compares the progression of brand partnerships to his experience of navigating different visas to stay in the U.S., a process of \\u201cjoining the dots.\\u201d We talked about Horizon Hobby, an Illinois-based remote control hobby retailer (think small planes and boats) that was the first-ever Imprint customer.\\n\\n\\u201cWe adore Horizon Hobby,\\u201d Murphy told Fortune. \\u201cThey took the first bet on Imprint. From Horizon Hobby, we were able to go to Westgate. From Westgate, we were able to go to Holiday Inn and so on.\\u201d\\n\\nBecause Murphy is someone who remembers where he came from\\u2014and is prepared for when life (and cows) get messy.\\n\\nICYMI\\u2026Cerebras, a VC-backed AI chipmaker, is reportedly looking at postponing its IPO plans.\\n\\nSee you tomorrow,\\n\\nAllie Garfinkle\\n\\nTwitter: @agarfinks\\n\\nEmail: alexandra.garfinkle@fortune.com\\n\\nSubmit a deal for the Term Sheet newsletter here.\\n\\nNina Ajemian curated the deals section of today\\u2019s newsletter.\\n\\nVENTURE DEALS\\n\\n- ShiraTronics, a Minneapolis, Minn.-based neurostimulation therapies developer for chronic migraine patients, raised $66 million in Series B funding.

The unemployment rate also ticked lower to 4.1%.\\n\\nStocks rallied on the news with the Dow Jones Industrial Average closing at a record high.\\n\\nGoldman Sachs reacted by slashing the probability of a recession in the next 12 months to the long-term average of 15%.

But for now, the financial world is breathing easier.\\n\\nPiercing the recession cloud\\n\\nThe specter of recession has been looming over the US economy for several years. Gobs of fiscal stimulus in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, coupled with global supply disruptions, drove inflation to a 40-year high of more than 9% in early 2022. The Federal Reserve reacted by raising interest rates from nearly zero to above 5% in less than 18 months.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThe upshot for many people has been a double-whammy of higher costs for essentials like food, fuel, and housing, and steeper monthly payments on their mortgages, car loans, credit cards, and other debts.\\n\\nThe sharp increase in living costs threatened to curb spending, investing, and hiring, and hobble debt-reliant industries like commercial real estate and related sectors such as regional banks.\\n\\nThere's certainly been some pain, but inflation has cooled in recent months and touched 2.5% in August, not far above the Fed's 2% target. That spurred the central bank to make its first rate cut \\u2014 a \\\"jumbo\\\" reduction of 50 basis points \\u2014 last month.\\n\\nThe latest jobs report has relieved some concerns about the economy, but also dashed hopes for another jumbo cut in November. This week's inflation reading should provide a better idea of whether price growth is truly under control.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nWhile everything from storms and strikes to wars and foreign stimulus mean there's always a chance something will go wrong, the sun appears to be peeking through the clouds. The optimistic outlook is also good news for Kamala Harris too.\"\n",

Israel appears to be inching closer to a direct conflict with Iran, a grim prospect that has been avoided for years as the two countries limited their fight to proxies in a shadow war.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThe results of the yearlong conflict, with origins that date back decades, have been costly for both Israel and the Iranian-led \\\"Axis of Resistance,\\\" noted Chuck Freilich, a former deputy national security advisor who served for over 20 years in Israel's security establishment.\\n\\n\\\"Israel has turned the tide and has the Axis of Resistance on the defensive. Hamas has been defeated militarily, though not politically, and remains in political control in Gaza,\\\" Freilich told Business Insider, adding that Iran had come to be in a vulnerable position.\\n\\n\\\"Conversely, Israel was in the midst of a multifront war which may result in significant damage to its homefront and is deeply isolated in the world,\\\" he added.\\n\\nA year of bloodshed\\n\\nIsrael's response to Hamas' attack on October 7 was a massive bombardment campaign and later ground incursion in Gaza, which Palestinian authorities say have left about 42,000 people dead.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAmid the early stages of that campaign, the first high-profile expansion of the greater conflict blew open in late October, when Yemen's Houthi rebels began attacking commercial ships in the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea, a crucial global shipping route.\\n\\nThe Houthis, historically backed and armed by Iran, said they were declaring a show of support for Hamas by attacking ships linked to Israel, though they were often found to have used drones, missiles, and raiding parties to harass vessels with no direct relation to it.\\n\\nThe Houthis say they are attacking ships in the Red Sea in solidarity with Palestinians. Mohammed Hamoud/Getty Images\\n\\nWith the Houthi attacks threatening to close off a vital international shipping lane, the US and its allies and partners established a heavy military presence in the Red Sea to fend off the rebels.\\n\\nJanuary saw the West's most direct and overt military involvement in the conflict, when the US, the UK, and their allies barraged Houthi targets with airborne, surface, and subsurface-launched strikes after warning the rebels repeatedly to cease their attacks.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThe campaign has dragged on for almost a year with no end in sight, and the US has been rotating aircraft-carrier groups into the region while carrying out further strikes on Houthi territory.\\n\\nTo the north, Syria became the site of further conflict in April, when Israel launched a strike on the Iranian Consulate in Damascus, killing several senior officials of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, including two generals.\\n\\nRelated stories\\n\\nDetailing the attack's significance, Farzin Nadimi, a senior fellow at The Washington Institute for Near East Policy, described it as the \\\"first time Israel struck an official Iranian government-affiliated site with high-ranking people inside.\\\"\\n\\nIranian officials inspecting the site of the Israeli strike on the consulate in April. Ammar Safarjalani/Xinhua via Getty Images\\n\\nIran followed up with a long-range attack on Israel at an unprecedented scale, launching what Israeli authorities said were 170 attack drones, 120 ballistic missiles, and 30 cruise missiles \\u2014 almost all of which were intercepted.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nIsrael then responded with its own strikes on cities in Iran. And in July, Ismail Haniyeh, the political leader of Hamas, was killed just after he attended the swearing-in of Iran's new president.\\n\\nHaniyeh was widely reported to have been killed by a remotely detonated explosive device that was planted months before his death in a guesthouse he was using in Tehran.\\n\\nIsrael also claimed responsibility that week for killing the Hezbollah commander Fuad Shukr, a senior advisor to the Lebanese militant organization's top leader, Hassan Nasrallah, via an air-launched strike in Beirut.\\n\\nA billboard in Beirut depicting Ismail Haniyeh, Qasem Soleimani, and Fuad Shukr in front of the slogan \\\"We are avenging.\\\" JOSEPH EID/AFP via Getty Images\\n\\nHezbollah, a longtime enemy of Israel, had been exchanging fire with Israel since the October 7 attacks, forcing hundreds of thousands of civilians on both sides to flee from areas near Israel's border with Lebanon.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nIn one of the most dramatic attacks the region has yet seen, thousands of pagers and communication devices used by Hezbollah detonated in September, injuring more than 2,800 people and killing at least eight.\\n\\nMossad, the Israeli spy agency, is widely believed to have orchestrated the attack by planting explosives inside the devices before they were distributed, but Israel has not claimed responsibility.\\n\\nIsrael has been carrying out strikes in southern Lebanon. JALAA MAREY/AFP via Getty Images\\n\\nLater in September, Israel launched a strike that killed Nasrallah at Hezbollah's headquarters in Beirut, bringing an end to his 32-year leadership of the militant group.\\n\\nThen, at the start of this month Israel began what it called a limited ground incursion into Lebanon, saying it sought to dismantle Hezbollah's positions and artillery in the south.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nIran moved soon after to launch a second major attack on Israel. Tehran is reported to have fired about 200 missiles, including its advanced Fattah missile capable of reaching speeds of Mach 5.\\n\\nIt's unclear whether Israel might expand its scope in Lebanon, where it faces difficult terrain and Hezbollah troops who have had years to embed and prepare.\\n\\nLebanon's health ministry has said more than 2,000 people have been killed so far in the ensuing strikes and raids.\\n\\nEscalations don't bode well for the Middle East\\n\\nHistory shows there's little chance that Israel will let Iran's attack pass without a response.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\\"If you strike us, we will strike you,\\\" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly on September 27, before Iran's latest salvo. \\\"There is no place in Iran that the long arm of Israel cannot reach, and that's true of the entire Middle East.\\\"\\n\\nMeanwhile, last month hundreds of thousands of Israeli protesters rallied against Netanyahu's failure to secure some sort of cease-fire deal that could lead to the release of the hostages remaining in Gaza after the attack one year ago.\\n\\nRelated stories\\n\\nGili Roman, whose sister was kidnapped on October 7 and later released and whose relative Carmel Gat was among the six slain hostages recovered by the IDF in early September, told BI last month that Netanyahu and his government were \\\"prioritizing themselves\\\" over the hostages.\\n\\nThe anticipation of yet another cycle of escalating retaliation has set the world on edge, amid fears that an all-out war between Iran and Israel will destabilize the entire region.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nGlobally, the immediate concern is that oil supplies will diminish significantly should conflict spill over to the rest of the Middle East.\\n\\nLast week, Citigroup analysts estimated that a major strike on Iranian oil infrastructure could reduce global oil supplies by 1.5 million barrels a day.\\n\\nIsrael ignores US red lines\\n\\nUS President Joe Biden has for a year been trying to keep the war from growing into a wider regional conflict that could pull in the US and other world powers.\\n\\nHe has repeatedly sought to broker a cease-fire in Gaza, organize more humanitarian support for civilians, and limit Israel's campaign.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nBut Netanyahu has repeatedly ignored Biden's red lines and has continued to push forward against Hamas even as the civilian death toll spiraled and international opposition to Israel's campaign mounted.\\n\\nThe US also helped shield Israel against both rounds of Iranian attacks and has positioned troops in the area while seeking to tamp down the conflict.\\n\\nBut as Israel intensified its attacks against Hezbollah two weeks ago, the US announced that it had brokered a possible cease-fire agreement \\u2014 only for Israel to assassinate Nasrallah one day later.\\n\\nCritics of US policy believe that Netanyahu is acting in his own self-interest to try to hold together his fragile coalition government, whose far-right members support intensifying the war against Iran and its allies.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\\"Netanyahu doesn't care about his friendship with Biden, or even about Israel's dependence on the United States. He cares only about his near-term political interests. Everyone but Biden can see this,\\\" Andrew Exum, a former US deputy assistant secretary of defense for Middle East policy, wrote in The Atlantic last week.\\n\\nThe global economy on edge\\n\\nWhen the conflict began a year ago, there were fears that wider conflict in the Middle East could affect the global economy.\\n\\nOil prices did rise in the days after the October 7 attacks, but after peaking above $92 a barrel later that month, Brent crude had declined to about $73 in mid-December. In contrast, oil hit about $130 a barrel after Vladimir Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.\\n\\nStill, experts speaking with Business Insider noted recently that a wider war in the region could choke global economic growth and reignite inflation.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThe Bank of Israel estimated in May that the costs arising from the war would total about $66 billion through the end of next year \\u2014 equivalent to roughly 12% of Israel's gross domestic product, according to Reuters.\\n\\nAnd in June, the International Monetary Fund noted that the long-term economic effects of severe conflict on real GDP per capita in the Middle East had tended to be particularly pronounced, compared with other regions.\\n\\nIt said that countries in the Middle East could expect to experience a roughly 10% decline in real GDP per capita a decade after the onset of a conflict, compared with pre-conflict levels.\\n\\nCorrection: October 7, 2024 \\u2014 An earlier version of this story misstated when Israel launched its strike that killed Hassan Nasrallah. That attack took place before Israel's ground incursion into Lebanon, not after, and the subsequent Iranian missile strike came soon after the Israeli ground assault, not hours after Nasrallah's killing. The story also misspelled the name of the former deputy national security advisor in Israel. He is Chuck Freilich, not Chuck Frielich.\"\n",

Musk had in an X post accused the government of closing the airspace in Asheville, North Carolina, to block recovery efforts.\\n\\nMusk also blamed the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the government's disaster-relief group, and the Federal Aviation Administration.\\n\\nButtigieg responded to Musk, writing: \\\"No one is shutting down the airspace and FAA doesn't block legitimate rescue and recovery flights. If you're encountering a problem give me a call.\\\"\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThe two men then had a chat via phone call, Buttigieg said in an interview with MSNBC's Jen Psaki released on Sunday.\\n\\n\\\"He called,\\\" Buttigieg told Psaki. \\\"We had a conversation.\\\"\\n\\nButtigieg told MSNBC that some of the confusion on X stemmed from temporary flight restrictions, which the FAA introduced to ensure safety for aircraft conducting Hurricane Helene rescue and recovery activities.\\n\\nButtigieg said he and Musk managed to get to the bottom of what was happening and sort out problems for pilots helping to get Starlink equipment to disaster-hit areas.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\\"We were able to take care of it,\\\" Buttigieg said. \\\"And, I think, to me it's an example of how often the best thing to do is just to pick up the phone.\\\"\\n\\nLater on Friday, Musk had a more positive tone while replying to a post from Buttigieg on X about the government delivering additional emergency relief to South Carolina.\\n\\nRelated stories\\n\\n\\\"Thanks for expediting approval for support flights,\\\" Musk said. \\\"Just wanted to note that Sec Buttigieg is on the ball.\\\"\\n\\nButtigieg replied, writing: \\\"Glad we could address \\u2014 thanks for engaging.\\\"\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nMusk and Buttigieg have had public disagreements over topics including tax credits for electric vehicles and the safety of driverless cars.\\n\\nLately, Musk has also been slamming the FAA, accusing it of playing favorites with Boeing instead of giving equal treatment to Musk's space-exploration company, SpaceX. The FAA falls under the Department of Transportation.\\n\\nRepresentatives of the Department of Transportation and Musk didn't immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider, sent outside business hours.\\n\\nHurricane Helene made landfall in Florida on September 26 and swept through Georgia and the Carolinas, causing widespread damage. Moody's Analytics projected that damage from the disaster could cost the US up to $34 billion, with estimated property damage ranging from $15 billion to $26 billion.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nFEMA said in a September 30 press release that it had deployed Starlink satellites made by SpaceX to areas that needed internet access after the hurricane.\"\n",

The team then raised their price target to 5,200 in February and once again to 5,600 in June.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nKostin also raised the bank's 12-month S&P 500 price target to 6,300 from 6,000.\\n\\n\\\"The primary driver of the upward revision to our 2025 EPS estimate is greater margin expansion,\\\" Kostin said. \\\"We expect sales will grow by 5%, roughly in line with nominal GDP growth. However, we now expect 78 bp of net margin expansion in 2025, compared with 24 bp previously.\\\"\\n\\nKostin said his assumptions are based on a relatively \\\"steady\\\" macro economic outlook, with US real GDP growing at an average pace of 2.3% in 2025 and 2.0% in 2026.\\n\\nAt the micro level, Kostin highlighted three reasons he expects higher corporate profits in the year ahead.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nFirst, Kostin said idiosyncratic charges and write-downs for a handful of S&P 500 companies weighed on corporate profits in 2024 and should moderate in 2025. Those companies include Bristol-Myers Squibb, Gilead, and Warner Bros. Discovery.\\n\\nSecond, Kostin believes a recovery in the semiconductor cycle should boost technology companies' earnings per share in 2025.\\n\\n\\\"Shipments of integrated circuits excluding memory chips, a predictor of Semis margins, are roughly 10% below their historical trend. Reversion to trend should lead to margin expansion through 2026,\\\" Kostin explained.\\n\\nFinally, mega-cap tech companies should continue to see solid profit growth, in part thanks to AI trends.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\\"While the magnitude of beats may moderate, the recent GS Communacopia Conference indicated strong ongoing AI demand that should benefit these stocks,\\\" Kostin said.\\n\\nKostin's price target forecasts assume the S&P 500 continues to trade at a premium valuation of about 22x forward earnings. If that earnings multiple drops, it would threaten Kostin's bullish outlook.\\n\\n\\\"If prospects for growth weaken, the S&P 500 could trade at 18x (5400, 6% downside),\\\" Kostin said.\"\n",

Despite the short length of the Chinese rally, the MSCI China Index is up by more than 34% in the year to date, surpassing gains for the US benchmark S&P 500.\\n\\n\\\"The significant gains in the equity market have been driven by two key factors: the catalyst of more substantial policy measures and the starting conditions of an oversold and under-positioned market backdrop,\\\" Goldman said.\\n\\nThat's a reference to a sweeping set of policies Beijing introduced in late September, signaling the government's seriousness about tackling China's lagging economy. Measures included liquidity boosts, interest-rate easing, reserve-ratio-requirement cuts, and mortgage-rate support.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nGoldman detailed four reasons to support its forecast of 15% to 20% upside for Chinese stocks.\\n\\nFirst, valuations have room to expand if Beijing commits to its policy support. Even though they've recovered from a low of 8.4 times forward earnings, valuations remain below a five-year mean of 12.1 times, Goldman said. It added that fiscal easing often corresponds with expanding valuations.\\n\\nSecond, China's recent policy announcements likely clamp down on investment risk. Before Beijing delivered its forceful stimulus blitz, the market's implied cost of equity was elevated, indicating lingering concern about downside risk. China's commitment to its new policies should ease this measure.\\n\\nThird, earnings growth could pick up if the economy responds well to China's latest support measures. Goldman is optimistic in this outcome, estimating that the central bank's policy easing could lift China's GDP by 40 basis points.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\\"Our economists currently forecast GDP growth of 4.7% and 4.3% for 2024 and 2025 but note that the announced and indicated measures reduce downside growth risks inherent in recent monthly activity data,\\\" the bank said.\\n\\nFourth, equity positioning is light, leaving room for more market entrants that could push stocks higher, Goldman said.\\n\\nWith risk appetite returning to onshore and foreign investors, market participation is rising from low levels. But even as traders snap up Chinese equities, their exposure remains lax. For instance, mutual funds were 310 basis points underweight China at the end of August, Goldman said; the rally's jump-start only deepens this figure.\\n\\nStill, while Goldman said efforts so far had been very stocks-positive, it's not willing to declare that a structural bull market has begun. It said China continues to suffer major challenges, including low consumer spending and an indebted property market. Some analysts have argued that even more support is necessary, especially fiscal stimulus.\"\n",

Bush.\\n\\nFollowing 9/11, the Bush administration stepped up its security involvement in the region by strengthening the US military presence there and increasing diplomatic ties with key ASEAN nations.\\n\\nThe Obama administration then pursued a policy of strategic \\\"rebalancing,\\\" with the underlying goal of preventing China from becoming the dominant power in the Asia-Pacific region.\\n\\nThe Trump administration took a harder line, stepping up its freedom of navigation patrols, conducting naval exercises in the region, and at one point deploying all of its forward-deployed nuclear attack submarines into the Western Pacific.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nMarston said the Biden administration has adopted elements of Obama's policy and tried to ramp up diplomatic efforts and strengthen US alliances and security partnerships.\\n\\nYet, China has remained undeterred in its efforts to dominate the contested islands, and has grown more aggressive in encounters with regional claimants, notably the Philippines.\\n\\n\\\"It's really plagued multiple administrations,\\\" Martson said.\\n\\nA polarized region\\n\\nGregory B. Poling, director of the Center for Strategic and International Studies' Southeast Asia Program and the Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative, told BI that the South China Sea has served as a \\\"wedge\\\" within ASEAN because only four out of 10 countries have a direct stake in it.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\\"Frankly, a lot of them would rather the Philippines, Vietnam, Indonesia, and Malaysia just give up their rights in order to make this issue go away so they can get back to trading and investing with China,\\\" he said.\\n\\nAccording to Chatham House's Hayton, increased US intervention could further split the alliance and also potentially drag the US into a conflict with China that jeopardizes Southeast Asian countries' economies.\\n\\nThe US might be called in to help enforce freedom of navigation or defend its partners in the event of a military confrontation between China and its neighbors.\\n\\nAdm. Samuel Paparo , head of the US Indo-Pacific Command, hinted at this last August, saying the US could send ships to escort Philippine vessels in the South China Sea following clashes with China in recent months.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nEven without a boosted US presence, the US could be dragged into a regional confrontation via its partners.\\n\\nAt a minimum, Hayton said a conflict would trigger disruptions to shipping, supply lines, and supply chains and hurt the region's economic growth, \\\"even before we start to think about military actions.\\\"\\n\\nA conflict in the South China Sea \\u2014 a critical trade route estimated to carry one-third of global shipping \\u2014 could result in a 10-33% loss in GDP for Taiwan, Singapore, Hong Kong, Vietnam, the Philippines, and Malaysia, according to a 2020 working paper by the US National Bureau of Economic Research.\\n\\nEscalating tensions\\n\\nTensions in the region have been escalating over the past few months, especially between China and the Philippines.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nA month after the armed encounter, China's largest coastguard vessel dropped anchor in the Philippines' exclusive economic zone, and in August, a Philippine Coast Guard spokesperson said China had deployed 40 vessels to block the delivery of supplies to its soldiers stationed in the contested Sabina Shoal.\\n\\nEarlier this week, the Philippines said three Chinese Coast Guard vessels and a navy ship fired water cannons toward two civilian vessels while they were on a routine resupply mission in the West Philippine Sea.\\n\\nA Philippine Coast Guard vessel and a Chinese Coast Guard vessel during an incident in the South China Sea on August 19, 2024.

He plans to work on \\\"reestablishing Starbucks as the community coffeehouse\\\" and \\\"empowering our baristas to take care of our customers,\\\" he wrote in an open letter published last month.\\n\\n\\\"Many of our customers still experience this magic every day, but in some places \\u2014 especially in the U.S. \\u2014 we aren't always delivering,\\\" Niccol wrote. \\\"It can feel transactional, menus can feel overwhelming, product is inconsistent, the wait too long or the handoff too hectic. These moments are opportunities for us to do better.\\\"\\n\\nNiccol is spending his first 100 days at Starbucks getting to know the business, including visiting some of the chain's stores, according to the letter. He is Starbucks' fourth CEO in less than three years. He follows Laxman Narasimhan, who took the job in 2023 after a transition period, Howard Schultz, who served as interim CEO starting in 2022, and Kevin Johnson, who was CEO between 2017 and 2022.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThere's evidence that Starbucks needs a turnaround. The chain's North American sales have fallen in the last two quarters that it has reported. Starbucks' stock price was down roughly 20% this year until August, when Starbucks appointed Niccol and its shares erased those losses.\\n\\nAnalysts have said Niccol may be the right man for the job. As Chipotle's CEO, he led the brand's recovery from a food safety crisis and oversaw the creation of online ordering at the chain.\\n\\nBusiness Insider has spoken to 10 Starbucks store workers \\u2014 whom the company calls \\\"partners\\\" \\u2014 since the chain announced Niccol would become CEO. They declined to have their names used in this article for fear of retaliation from Starbucks, but BI has verified their identities and employment with the company. Starbucks had about 219,000 partners at its company-operated stores as of last October, according to its latest annual filing with the SEC.\\n\\nHere are the issues that they said they hope Niccol addresses:\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nSome Starbucks stores should feel more like a 'third place'\\n\\nNot all Starbucks stores feel like great places to hang out, some partners told BI.\\n\\nRelated stories\\n\\nOne store in Florida, for instance, has an old, worn-down floor that has become difficult to clean, according to one partner who works there. That leads to a stench in some parts of the caf\\u00e9 that turns off patrons, they said.\\n\\n\\\"If you stand too close to the bar or lean over to get a straw, you might get a whiff,\\\" the partner said. \\\"I've had customers who can see the condition of the floor, and they're like 'What?'\\\"\\n\\nA Starbucks spokesperson directed BI to comments from former CEO Narasimhan on the company's July earnings call about Starbucks' plans to renovate about 800 stores in North America by the end of the company's 2024 fiscal year.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAnother partner at a Starbucks store previously told BI that the Siren Craft System, which the company has touted as a way to streamline drink production and free up partners to serve customers, often forces partners at his store to put off tasks, including cleaning.\\n\\nEmployees at many Starbucks locations also have to juggle serving customers who visit the caf\\u00e9s to enjoy their coffee there and those who want a quick cup of coffee to go \\u2014 perhaps by ordering through Starbucks' mobile app \\u2014 and to avoid talking to anyone. \\\"It's no longer the third place,\\\" one Starbucks store manager in Florida previously told BI. \\\"It's a pit stop.\\\"\\n\\nStarbucks should hire more workers to shorten wait times\\n\\nShifts at Starbucks stores are often short-staffed, multiple partners have told BI.\\n\\nOne store in North Carolina usually has just two or three partners on duty outside of a two-hour shift in the morning, one partner who works there said. The store needs one or two more workers during those shifts to function smoothly and get customers their orders without long delays, he said.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nStarbucks stores often schedule more workers in the morning, when customers are likely to stop by for coffee. But far fewer workers are on the floor later in the day at some stores.\\n\\nThe Florida store with the worn-out floor is often overwhelmed when students from a nearby school stop by in the afternoon, the partner there said.\\n\\n\\\"Monday through Friday, there's an afterschool rush at 3:00 p.m., and we never have enough people to work it,\\\" the partner said. That leads to \\\"big lines that wrap around the building,\\\" the partner added.\\n\\nStarbucks needs a better way to manage mobile orders\\n\\nPartners at some stores say that they struggle to fill orders that customers place through the chain's mobile app in a timely manner, BI has reported.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nDuring busy times of the day, one Starbucks store in North Carolina receives up to 20 mobile orders at a time, a partner who works there told BI. This year, the problem has gotten so bad that the store has closed in-person ordering just to catch up, the partner said.\\n\\nAnother partner in South Dakota told BI that promotions through the app, such as four drinks for $20, make it especially hard for workers to keep up.\\n\\nStarbucks should rethink its bring-your-own-cup incentive\\n\\nIn January, Starbucks said that it would start letting US customers bring their own clean, reusable cups to caf\\u00e9s to hold the drinks that they order. The move was meant to cut the number of single-use plastic cups that the chain uses, and customers get a 10-cent discount and rewards points for the effort. Starbucks said about 400,000 of its rewards members brought in a personal cup for an order in the several days following the announcement.\\n\\nBut a partner at a Starbucks in Florida said those incentives are too minor and don't seem to be pushing many customers to bring in their own cups. \\\"That's not motivational, not to the average person,\\\" the partner said.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\\"I love my job, I love the company, but things have to change because of what we're doing to the environment,\\\" the partner added.\\n\\nA Starbucks spokesperson said the company has seen \\\"encouraging results\\\" since starting the reusable cup initiative in January.\\n\\nDo you work at Starbucks and have a story idea to share?

      "            \"text\": \"Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump promises the biggest deportation event the U.S. has ever seen if he is elected \\u2014 a promise he has predicated, in part, on the notion that immigrants in the U.S. legally and illegally are stealing what he calls \\u201cBlack jobs\\u201d and \\u201cHispanic jobs.\\u201d\\n\\nBut government data show immigrant labor contributes to economic growth and provides promotional opportunities for native-born workers. And a mass deportation event would cost U.S. taxpayers up to a trillion dollars and could cause the cost of living, including food and housing, to skyrocket, economists say.\\n\\nHere\\u2019s a look at immigration and the U.S. labor market, and what Trump\\u2019s plan would mean for the U.S. economy.\\n\\nWhat has Trump said?\\n\\nTrump, who often uses anti-immigrant rhetoric, has referred during his campaign to immigrants he says are taking \\u201cBlack jobs\\u201d and \\u201cHispanic jobs.\\u201d\\n\\nAt a recent rally in Reading, Pennsylvania, Trump said, \\u201cYou have an invasion of people into our country.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThey\\u2019re going to be attacking \\u2014 and they already are \\u2014 Black population jobs, the Hispanic population jobs, and they\\u2019re attacking union jobs too,\\u201d Trump said. \\u201cSo when you see the border, it\\u2019s not just the crime. Your jobs are being taken away too.\\u201d\\n\\nTrump\\u2019s rhetoric about jobs has been widely condemned by Democrats and Black leaders who have called it a racist and insulting way of implying that Black and Hispanic Americans take menial jobs.\\n\\nJaniyah Thomas, the director of Team Trump Black Media, told The Associated Press that Democrats \\u201ccontinue to prioritize the interests of illegal immigrants over our own Black Americans who were born in this country\\u201d and that Biden-era job gains in the labor market were primarily due to illegal immigration.\\n\\nThe latest U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Current Population Survey data shows that as of 2023, native-born Black workers are most predominantly employed in management and financial operations, sales and office support roles, while native-born Latino workers are most often employed in management, office support, sales and service occupations.\\n\\nForeign-born, noncitizen Black workers are most often represented in transportation and health care support roles, and foreign-born, noncitizen Hispanic workers are most often represented in construction, building and grounds cleaning.\\n\\nHow has immigration contributed to U.S. growth?\\n\\nIn 2023, international migrants \\u2014 primarily from Latin America \\u2014 accounted for more than two-thirds of the population growth in the United States, and so far this decade they have made up almost three-quarters of U.S. growth.\\n\\nAfter hitting a record high in December 2023, the number of migrants crossing the border has plummeted.\\n\\nThe claim that immigrants are taking employment opportunities from native-born Americans is repeated by Trump\\u2019s advisers. They often cite a report produced by Steven Camarota, research director for the Center for Immigration Studies, a right-leaning think tank that seeks a reduced immigration flow into the U.S. The report combines job numbers for immigrants in the U.S. legally and illegally to reinforce the claim that foreigners are disproportionately driving U.S. labor growth and reaping most of the benefits.\\n\\nCamarota\\u2019s report states that 971,000 more U.S.-born Americans were employed in May 2024 compared to May 2019, prior to the pandemic, while the number of employed immigrants has increased by 3.2 million.\\n\\nIt is true that international migrants have become a primary driver of population growth this decade, increasing their share of the overall population as fewer children are being born in the U.S. compared with years past. That\\u2019s according to the U.S. Census Bureau\\u2019s annual American Community Survey.\\n\\nAre immigrants taking native-born workers\\u2019 jobs?\\n\\nEconomists who study immigrant labor\\u2019s impact on the economy say that people who are in the U.S. illegally are not taking native citizens\\u2019 jobs, because the roles that these immigrant workers take on are most often positions that native workers are unwilling to fill, such as agriculture and food processing jobs.\\n\\nGiovanni Peri, a labor economist at the University of California, Davis, conducted research that explores the impact of the 1980 influx of Cuban immigrants in Miami (the so-called Mariel Boatlift) on Black workers\\u2019 employment. The study determined that the wages of Miami\\u2019s Black and Hispanic workers moved above those in other cities that did not have a surge of immigrant workers.\\n\\nPeri told the AP that the presence of new immigrant labor often improves employment outcomes for native-born workers, who often have different language and skill sets compared to new immigrants.\\n\\nIn addition, there are not a fixed number of jobs in the U.S., immigrants tend to contribute to the survival of existing firms (opening up new opportunities for native workers) and there are currently more jobs available than there are workers available to take them. U.S. natives have low interest in working in labor-intensive agriculture and food production roles.\\n\\n\\u201cWe have many more vacancies than workers in this type of manual labor, in fact we need many more of them to fill these roles,\\u201d Peri said.\\n\\nStan Marek, who employs roughly 1,000 workers at his Houston construction firm, Marek Brothers Holdings LLC, said he has seen this firsthand.\\n\\nAsked if immigrants in the U.S. illegally are taking jobs from native-born workers, he said, \\u201cAbsolutely not, unequivocally.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cMany of my workers are retiring, and their kids are not going to come into construction and the trades,\\u201d Marek said. He added that the U.S. needs an identification system that addresses national security concerns so those who are in the country illegally can work.\\n\\n\\u201cThere\\u2019s not enough blue-collar labor here,\\u201d he said.\\n\\nData also shows when there are not enough workers to fill these roles, firms will automate their jobs with machines and technology investments, rather than turn to native workers.\\n\\nDartmouth University economist Ethan Lewis said, \\u201cThere is a vast amount of research on the labor market impact of immigration in the U.S., most of which concludes the impact on less-skilled workers is fairly small and, if anything, jobs for U.S.-born workers might by created rather than \\u2018taken\\u2019 by immigrants.\\u201d\\n\\nHow would mass deportations affect the economy?\\n\\nTrump has said he would focus on rounding up migrants by deploying the National Guard, whose troops can be activated on orders of a governor.\\n\\nPeri says a deportation program would cost the U.S. up to a trillion dollars and would result in massive losses to the U.S. economy. The cost of food and other basic items would soar.\\n\\n\\u201cThey are massive contributors to our economy and we wouldn\\u2019t have fruits and vegetables, we wouldn\\u2019t have our gardens,\\u201d he said, if the deportation effort comes to fruition.\\n\\nSince the labor force made up of people in the U.S. illegally makes up roughly 4% of U.S. GDP annually, he estimates that mass deportation would result in a roughly $1 trillion loss.\\n\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s a cost that is mind-boggling in terms of income loss, production loss and there will be a logistical cost to organize this,\\u201d he said.\\n\\nTreasury Secretary Janet Yellen said this month in a podcast interview with David Axelrod that immigrant labor \\u201cis an important source of labor force growth.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cOn balance, it helps the economy grow without actually depriving other people of jobs,\\u201d she said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s not in any way a zero-sum game.\\u201d\"\n",

And housing starts the following day will probably point to cooler residential construction.\\n\\nThe impact on September economic data from Hurricane Helene may be modest considering landfall occurred late in the month. However, Helene and Hurricane Milton are expected to skew October data.\\n\\nFed officials speaking in the coming week include Christopher Waller, Neel Kashkari and Mary Daly.\\n\\nTurning north, the Bank of Canada will be watching for more cooling in core inflation in September\\u2019s data after the headline rate finally reached the 2% target in August.\\n\\nHowever, a small upside surprise wouldn\\u2019t throw policymakers off their easing track, as they\\u2019ve said they expect some bumpiness on the path toward a sustainable return to the target.\\n\\nAsia\\n\\nChina\\u2019s in the spotlight all week, culminating in growth figures Friday that are likely to show the economy is still expanding below the 5% target for the year.\\n\\nThat outcome would underscore why authorities undertook aggressive easing measures late last month, and presented another salvo of support on Saturday.\\n\\nBeijing will publish a slew of monthly figures, including industrial output and retail sales for September, along with third-quarter gross domestic product data. Property investment probably fell at a double-digit clip for a fifth straight month.\\n\\nThe week kicks off with figures on Sunday expected to show that China\\u2019s consumer inflation continued to limp along at an anemic 0.6% in September, while declines in factory-gate prices deepened.\\n\\nElsewhere, the Monetary Authority of Singapore issues its policy statement on Monday, while Southeast Asia gets a blast of central bank action on Wednesday.\\n\\nIn Manila, Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas is forecast to cut its benchmark and standing overnight deposit facility rates by a quarter-point each, while the Bank of Thailand and Bank Indonesia may hold their policy settings steady.\\n\\nConsumer prices in Japan for September are seen rising faster than the Bank of Japan\\u2019s target for a 27th straight month, and Australia gets labor statistics on Thursday that may reflect continued tightness.\\n\\nSingapore\\u2019s growth probably picked up in the third quarter, according to the consensus estimate for data on Monday. Trade data are due from China, Japan, Indonesia, India, Singapore and Malaysia, and New Zealand is set to publish third-quarter consumer price figures.\\n\\nEurope, Middle East, Africa\\n\\nAside from the ECB decision, the UK is likely to prove a key focus, with data on wages, inflation and retail sales all scheduled for release.\\n\\nWith Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey having signaled he could be open to a more aggressive approach to easing, the numbers will offer a glimpse on whether the consumer-price backdrop has become benign enough to allow that.\\n\\nEconomists anticipate that the inflation data will show weakening in September to below the 2% target for the first time since April 2021.\\n\\nIn the euro zone, Germany\\u2019s ZEW survey of investors is released at a time the country\\u2019s government is coming to terms with its new forecast, acknowledging that Europe\\u2019s biggest economy will probably contract this year.\\n\\nFiscal affairs may draw attention in Italy, with a budget due by Tuesday evening in time for a European Union deadline. Both Fitch Ratings and S&P Global Ratings are scheduled for potential updates on Italy after the market close on Friday.\\n\\nLooking south, in Israel on Tuesday, inflation, already above the official target of 1% to 3%, is expected to quicken further as the country engages in a multi-front conflict. Analysts predict the rate rose to 3.7% in September from 3.6% a month earlier.\\n\\nIn South Africa, the Reserve Bank will publish its biannual monetary policy review, providing guidance on the inflation and rate outlook. Governor Lesetja Kganyago will speak at the event.\\n\\nInvestors in Nigeria will watch to see if annual inflation continued to slow in September, even as price pressures built from higher fuel costs and devastating floods. Inflation is currently at 32.2%.\\n\\nIn Namibia, the central bank is set to lower its key interest rate, now at 7.5%, by 25 basis points on Wednesday in line with South Africa\\u2019s reduction last month. The Namibian dollar is pegged to the rand, which means monetary policy is often guided by the South African Reserve Bank\\u2019s actions.\\n\\nIn Turkey on Thursday, the central bank will likely hold its rate at 50% for a seventh straight meeting. Inflation has decelerated from 75% in May to 49% in September, but officials will want to see it drop further before they consider easing. Some analysts reckon policymakers will hold off on cuts until 2025.\\n\\nIn Egypt, the central bank is likely to hold its rate at 27.25% after data showing inflation quickened for a second straight month in September. Goldman Sachs is among the banks now predicting a delay to cuts in borrowing costs until early next year.\\n\\nLatin America\\n\\nAt Chile\\u2019s rate meeting, cooler-than-expected inflation data likely sews up a quarter-point rate cut to 5.25%. That would bring the central bank\\u2019s easing cycle to 600 basis points, with another 75 bps of reductions likely by the end of 2025.\\n\\nAmong the other big Latin American central banks, easing in Peru has largely tracked expectations, while action in Brazil, Colombia and Mexico has proved far more modest than the consensus estimates of mid-2023.\\n\\nIn other central bank news, monetary authorities in Chile, Brazil and Colombia will all publish much-watched surveys of expectations. In addition to economists and analysts, Chile also conducts a survey of traders, on tap for Monday.\\n\\nUnemployment in Peru\\u2019s capital inched up to 6.1% in August, and may have edged up again in the September reading due Tuesday, but is running near a post-pandemic low as the economy continues to add jobs.\\n\\nAlso Tuesday, Colombia posts August readings on industrial production, manufacturing production and retail sales. The July prints were all in the black, the first such sweep in 17 months.\\n\\nGDP-proxy readings from Brazil, Colombia and Peru may show all three economies hitting headwinds in July after closing out the first half of the year on a high note.\"\n",

But officials still haven\\u2019t convinced economists that they\\u2019re doing enough to defeat deflation.\\n\\nAt a highly anticipated briefing on Saturday, Finance Minister Lan Fo\\u2019an refrained from putting a price tag on China\\u2019s fiscal stimulus as investors expected, signaling that details would come when China\\u2019s legislature meets in the coming weeks. The supportive measures he did announce, however, gave little indication Chinese authorities felt any urgency to ramp up consumption, which many economists see as essential to reflating the economy and putting it on a more positive growth trajectory.\\n\\n\\u201cThe policy to support consumption sounds quite weak,\\u201d said Jacqueline Rong, chief China economist at BNP Paribas SA. \\u201cIt is still too early to call an imminent significant turnaround in deflationary pressure or a bottoming-out of the property market, which are the two key issues faced by the Chinese economy.\\u201d\\n\\nData on Sunday will probably show consumer prices in September were stuck below 1% for a 19th straight month as factory-price deflation deepened, highlighting sluggish demand before the recent stimulus bonanza. Officials spoke little about deflation at the hourlong briefing on Saturday.\\n\\nPrior to the weekend, investors and analysts expected China to deploy as much as 2 trillion yuan ($283 billion) in fresh fiscal stimulus, including potential subsidies, consumption vouchers and financial support for families with children. That still might come in a few weeks: Last year, the Standing Committee of the National People\\u2019s Congress, China\\u2019s legislature, used a late-October meeting to announce a budget revision and additional bonds.\\n\\nBut Lan\\u2019s remarks on Saturday indicated that China is comfortable with the overall direction of the economy. He vowed to allow local governments to use special bonds to buy unsold homes and promised the biggest effort in recent years to relieve the debt burden of local authorities, neither of which is likely to provide a short-term boost to growth.\\n\\n\\u201cMy sense is that the fiscal policy moves will take a little too long to roll out for us to hit 5% this year, unless the ultimate scale of fiscal stimulus ends up being much larger than forecast,\\u201d said Lynn Song, chief economist for Greater China at ING Bank N.V., referring to China\\u2019s economic growth target for 2024.\\n\\nLan also hinted at room for issuing more sovereign bonds and greater government spending, steps that could be announced when legislators meet later this month or early November.\\n\\nAllowing local governments to swap their debt with cheaper loans will free up money for public services and encourage the authorities to spend more. And enabling them to use special bonds to buy unsold apartments and turn them into social housing may help stabilize a downturn in real estate prices, giving homeowners a greater sense of security.\\n\\nThe Finance Ministry didn\\u2019t provide an exact value for either measure. But these are among steps that lead economists to think \\u201cthis time can be different\\u201d after previous stimulus efforts faltered, according to Societe Generale SA.\\n\\n\\u201cThe prospects for a sustained recovery and reflation are improving, with better chances of housing stabilization and less pressure from local government deleveraging,\\u201d Wei Yao and Michelle Lam, both economists at the bank, said in a note.\\n\\nAs far as direct subsides are concerned, Lan said Saturday that China would hand out twice the number of scholarships and step up financial aid to students, a move that comes after youth unemployment rose in August to the highest level this year. He also vowed to continue to provide support to groups in need, citing a one-off handout to the poor last month as an example.\\n\\nThe lack of large-scale handouts is unsurprising, as Beijing has long looked down on what it calls \\u201cwelfarism.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cNo free food for lazy people is the fundamental thinking of policymakers as to why large-scale subsidy for the whole nation is unlikely,\\u201d said Bruce Pang, chief economist for Greater China at Jones Lang LaSalle Inc, referring to a similar comment made by the country\\u2019s top economic planning agency.\\n\\nEconomists have long urged a shift in priorities for fiscal policy to focus more on domestic consumption. Such a move toward a more balanced and sustainable growth model would reduce the country\\u2019s reliance on exports to power the economy amid rising trade tensions.\\n\\nThe old playbook of using debt-fueled investment into public projects \\u2014 from roads to bridges \\u2014 has become less effective after decades of urbanization left the country saturated with infrastructure. Because of a lack of high-quality projects, authorities have more money at their disposal than projects to spend it on.\\n\\nThe Finance Ministry said the government will expand the sectors eligible to receive funding support from the issuance of special local bonds. This could infuse the economy with as much as 1 trillion yuan now sitting idle, according to Ding Shuang, chief economist for Greater China and North Asia at Standard Chartered Plc.\\n\\nThe finance woes of local governments are closely linked with the property downturn. Land sales, a major driver of revenue, are dwindling just as a broader slowdown reduces taxes and other income sources. After going on a borrowing binge following the 2008 financial crisis to prop up growth, and then dealing with a costly pandemic, many localities are now struggling to meet daily spending needs, like paying civil servants.\\n\\nSome regions have opted to delay payments to contractors, impose hefty fines and slap companies with tax bills dating back decades. The moves have dealt a further blow to already fragile confidence in the private sector, prompting Beijing to warn local officials against excessive penalties.\\n\\nBy allowing local governments to swap more \\u201chidden debt,\\u201d Beijing is also trying to rein in credit risks at companies that borrowed aggressively on behalf of local governments in past years to help fund infrastructure. However, bonds spent for debt swaps generate no new growth in the economy even though they help maintain financial and social stability.\\n\\nEfforts to tackle local government debt risks \\u201clargely involve shifting debt from one arm of the state to another\\u201d and will have limited impact on near-term demand, said Julian Evans-Pritchard, head of China economics at Capital Economics. He maintained his 2024 growth forecast at 4.8% and revised up the forecast for next year to 4.5% from 4.3%, citing the fiscal boost.\\n\\nLarry Hu, head of China economics at Macquarie Group, said that China\\u2019s two-speed growth model in which it relies on manufacturing and exports to offset the property sector is \\u201cincreasingly unsustainable.\\u201d He said authorities will need to pivot once exports weaken or domestic demand deteriorates further, leading to social unrest.\\n\\n\\u201cThe strong sense of urgency from the September Politburo meeting suggests that it\\u2019s the pivot moment,\\u201d Hu wrote in a note on Saturday. \\u201cBut to confirm this, we need more evidence.\\u201d\"\n",

Heavy rain is expected before the storm arrives, and flooding is anticipated throughout the region. Florida Gov.

According to a senior campaign official who previewed the announcement, the plan is intended to appeal to the \\\"sandwich generation,\\\" or the adults who are raising kids while also caring for aging parents.\\n\\nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 37.1 million people \\u2014 14% of the US population \\u2014 provide unpaid eldercare in the country, and nearly 4.5 million people are in this lifestage.\\n\\nThe official said that Harris' proposal would cover services like in-home care aide, allowing seniors and families to avoid the high costs of a care facility or nursing home. This proposal follows previous plans Harris announced to lower the costs of childcare, including an expansion of the child tax credit and a $6,000 tax cut for families with newborn kids.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\\"There are so many people in our country who are right in the middle,\\\" Harris said during the interview. \\\"They're taking care of their kids, and they're taking care of their aging parents, and it's just almost impossible to do it all, especially if they work. We're finding that so many are then having to leave their job, which means losing a source of income, not to mention the emotional stress.\\\"\\n\\nAdditionally, according to a fact sheet from the Harris campaign, the \\\"Medicare at Home'\\\" initiative would provide coverage on a sliding scale for those with modest incomes to higher incomes to tailor coverage to the needs of older adults.\\n\\nMedicare currently does not fully cover the costs of long-term services like in-home aid, and eldercare costs are continuing to rise. According to a recent survey from Genworth, a long-term care insurance company, the average cost of in-home care stood at $75,504 in 2023 \\u2014 up from just over $68,000 in 2022.\\n\\nAt the same time, childcare costs remain high \\u2014 a report from Bank of America earlier this year found the average couple with two children spent over 30% of their combined wages on childcare costs, leaving families who are caring for both children and older adults in a financial bind.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nHarris' campaign official said her proposal to cover the costs of in-home care would be paid for by expanding Medicare drug price negotiations and increasing discounts drug manufacturers cover for certain brand-name drugs under Medicare, among other things.\\n\\nAlong with Medicare at Home, the Harris campaign outlined a proposal to expand Medicare to include vision and hearing coverage.\\n\\nRelated stories\\n\\nChildcare and eldercare have been focal points for the presidential campaign. While former President Donald Trump has not provided details on how he would tackle the costs of childcare \\u2014 he said during September remarks at the Economic Club of New York that he would increase tariffs when asked about childcare costs \\u2014 his VP pick, JD Vance, has previously suggested that grandparents help out more with childcare.\\n\\nVance later elaborated on his remarks during the vice presidential debate on October 1, saying that families need more childcare options: \\\"One of the biggest complaints I hear from young families is people who feel like they don't have options like they're choosing between going to work or taking care of their kids. That is an incredible burden to put on American families.\\\"\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nWith a rapidly aging population in the US, caring for older adults will likely become a more prevalent issue. Still, it's unclear if Congress would approve Harris' proposal; President Joe Biden has previously proposed expanding eldercare, which ultimately did make it into his 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law.\\n\\nAre you in the \\\"sandwich\\\" stage of life?

      "            \"text\": \"If you ever get the feeling that the rich keep getting richer, you\\u2019re not wrong. Not only do America\\u2019s top 10% own the majority of wealth in the country, but the top 1% control nearly a third.\\n\\nThat\\u2019s according to a new report from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO).\\n\\nThe report found that\\u2014adjusted for inflation\\u2014the wealth of America quadrupled between 1989 and 2022. In adjusted currency, Uncle Sam\\u2019s riches ballooned from $52 trillion to $199 trillion, at an average growth rate of about 4% a year.\\n\\nIn 2022 approximately 40% of Americans\\u2019 wealth was made up of retirement savings and Social Security benefits, with the rest being vested in home equity, non-retirement-related financial assets, and other holdings.\\n\\nBut not only is America getting richer, the CBO found, inequality became all the more pronounced over those three decades.\\n\\nIn 2022, families in America\\u2019s top 10% held 60% of all wealth, up from 56% in 1989. Families in the top 1% held 23% of the nation\\u2019s wealth in 1989, which has now grown to 27%.\\n\\nWhile that\\u2019s good news for the super-rich, those more widely in the top half of income distribution actually saw their share of assets dwindle in the 33-year window.\\n\\nThe share of wealth held by the group occupying the 10% to 40% range saw their portion shrink from 37% of the nation\\u2019s assets to 33%. Families in the bottom half of the distribution held 6% of all wealth in both 1989 and 2022.\\n\\nLife in the top 10%\\n\\nFamilies whose wealth exceeds $2.9 million find themselves in the top 10% of wealth in the States. But although the benchmark to join the exclusive club is a meager $3 million, the average funds of the top 10% in 2022 was $9.1 million.\\n\\n\\u201cAfter falling during the 2007\\u20132009 recession, the average wealth of the group rose, driven by increases in the value of all categories of assets,\\u201d the report reads. \\u201cFrom 2019 to 2022, the average value of almost every category of assets held by families in the group increased further.\\u201d\\n\\nTo be in America\\u2019s top 1%, the benchmark for entry is considerably higher\\u2014Bankrate puts the average wealth of the top echelon at $33.4 million in 2023.\\n\\nSuch levels of wealth would qualify many to fall within the boundaries for a proposed millionaires tax put forward by Sen. Bernie Sanders.\\n\\nThe issue of wealth inequality has piqued interest in recent months after Sanders discussed the topic with Microsoft cofounder and billionaire Bill Gates, who seemed open to some of the politician\\u2019s suggestions.\\n\\nSanders\\u2019s plan entails an annual 1% tax on a married couple\\u2019s net worth above $32 million. For example, a couple worth $32.5 million would pay an annual tax of $5,000. This tax rate would increase to 2% for couples with a net worth of $50 million to $250 million, 3% from $250 million to $500 million, and 4% from $500 million to $1 billion.\\n\\nFor the billionaire bracket, those with a net worth of between $2.5 billion and $5 billion would pay 6% tax over $32 million, 7% between $5 billion and $10 billion, and 8% on wealth over $10 billion.\\n\\nOf the plan, Gates told the On With Kara Swisher podcast in an episode released last week: \\u201cWe\\u2019d still have to grow the economy to get to the ideal level to set the safety net as high as Bernie alludes to. As you get richer, you raise the safety net.\\n\\n\\u201cThat\\u2019s the story of the United States, the government\\u2019s not very good at executing, so, you know, it\\u2019s always imperfect.\\u201d\\n\\nIndeed the CBO\\u2019s report concludes that the top 1% are driving wealth gains across America, so Sanders\\u2019s so-called \\u201csafety net\\u201d may be in for an increase in the near future.\\n\\n\\u201cFamily wealth was skewed toward families at the top of the wealth distribution over the entire 33-year period,\\u201d the CBO writes. \\u201cThe share of wealth held by families in the top 10% of the distribution increased; gains in the top 1% accounted for all of that growth.\\u201d\\n\\nThe bottom 25%\\n\\nWhen JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said the American Dream is disappearing, he wasn\\u2019t wrong. In an opinion piece for the Washington Post, the 68-year-old wrote: \\u201cThe American dream is disappearing for many because opportunity is not shared equally.\\u201d\\n\\nThe gains made by those on the lower end of the income spectrum\\u2014and their net wealth\\u2014are meager compared to those in the top percentile.\\n\\nAccording to the CBO report, families in the bottom 25% of wealth had less than $178,600 to their names. On average, they had $74,200. Of that cohort, 23%\\u2014or 8% of the overall population\\u2014had a negative net worth where their debt exceeded their marketable wealth.\\n\\nWhile inequality has become more pronounced, the bottom 25% are faring better than they did 30 years ago\\u2014and more so in recent years.\\n\\nThe CBO writes that growth of wealth in the bottom 25% averaged 3.9% from 1989 to 2019 and 12.4% from 2019 to 2022\\u2014largely driven by increases through Social Security wealth.\"\n",

      "            \"text\": \"Sixth Street has invested $130 million in atVenu, which processes $1.6 billion in food, beverage, and merchandise sales each year at live events. The private equity firm will have a \\u201cmeaningful stake\\u201d in atVenu, according to Michael McGinn, a Sixth Street partner and co-head of the growth unit. The deal closed Friday, Oct. 4.\\n\\nIn 2012, Ben Brannen, Derek Ball and James Seigel cofounded atVenu, which provides payments and inventory logistics software that helps artists and companies manage and complete the sale of merchandise, food, and beverages at live events such as concerts, festivals, and sports games.\\n\\nEd Sheeran was one of the first artists to use the atVenu software. \\u201cHe sells lots of T-shirts in the U.K.,\\u201d said Ball, who is atVenu\\u2019s CEO. Other AtVenu clients include the Final Four (NCAA), Coachella, and RedRocks.\\n\\nRunning live events isn\\u2019t easy. There are usually many different levels of operations involved including the tracking and selling of merchandise, said Brannen, who is atVenu\\u2019s president. There are also several different stakeholders who take part, including the artists or the sports teams, the fans attending the event, and promoters, as well as the company providing food and beverages.\\n\\nCustomers who use atVenu typically see their revenue increase by 20%, according to the company. \\u201cThe transient structure of live events can often be very difficult for traditional investors to understand and really wrap their minds around,\\u201d Brannen said.\\n\\nAtVenu\\u2019s software helps these parties sell merchandise in a frictionless way, he said. AtVenu, however, is not involved in the sale of tickets. \\u201cWe are not an ecommerce company. We are about facilitating purchases at live events,\\u201d said Brannen.\\n\\nAtVenu has raised about $38 million in funding, according to PitchBook. Frontier Growth invested $30 million in atVenu in 2022. Frontier and the company\\u2019s other investors, which include FJ Labs and Tekton Ventures, did not immediately reply to requests from comment. Some early investors will exit with the sale, said Sixth Street\\u2019s McGinn.\\n\\nAtVenu was profitable prior to the COVID-19 pandemic and then fell \\u201cinto the red\\u201d when the virus caused live events to shut down in 2020, said CEO Ball. He added that when the world began to open back up, there was considerable pent-up demand for live entertainment, leading the company to become profitable again.\\n\\nSixth Street first heard about atVenu when an associate bought a T-shirt at a concert in late 2023. The associate discovered that atVenu was providing the software that facilitated payments for the event. He got in contact with atVenu cofounders Brannen and Ball, who then ended up attending Sixth Street\\u2019s CEO conference in April. Sixth Street approached atVenu about investing, which prompted the company\\u2019s board to explore its options. Garrett DeNinno of Raymond James was hired to advise on a process over the summer that attracted private equity firms, Ball said. Sixth Street emerged as the victor. \\u201cSixth Street stood up very early as being the most likely candidate and as it ended, they were the right candidate for us, the right partner,\\u201d said Ball.\\n\\nAtVenu plans to use proceeds to fund its expansion internationally and push further into sports. Two years ago, atVenu began doing live events in the U.K., and this past summer it opened up in Spain and Germany, Brannen said. Both cofounders plan to stay with the company. AtVenu currently employs about 80 people and plans to use proceeds to hire, having just added its first employees in the U.K.\\n\\n\\u201cWe are going to drive this thing as hard as possible along with [Sixth Street]. We\\u2019re really the only ones out there thinking about live events the way that we do, and we understand all of those nuances that really make them challenging,\\u201d said Ball.\\n\\nThe investment comes just weeks since Sixth Street became one of several PE firms to be provisionally preapproved to invest in NFL teams. Sixth Street owns stakes in the NWSL\\u2019s Bay FC and the NBA\\u2019s San Antonio Spurs. (Sixth Street also owns a piece of FC Barcelona\\u2019s TV rights and the stadium of Real Madrid in Spain\\u2019s top soccer league.) Sixth Street\\u2019s investment came from its most recent growth fund that raised $4.4 billion in 2022.\\n\\n\\u201cWe want to help them build on the success that they\\u2019ve had in sports, and if there\\u2019s ways that we can help accelerate that growth, that\\u2019s what we\\u2019re focused on,\\u201d McGinn said.\"\n",

GIP, the infrastructure asset manager that BlackRock paid $12.5 billion for, is expected to add $250 million in management fees to BlackRock's bottom line in the fourth quarter alone.\\n\\n\\\"This is a meaningful accelerant to our private markets capabilities,\\\" he said.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nA quarter century after BlackRock went public \\u2014 the firm IPOed on October 1, 1999 \\u2014 the firm hopes to blend its private market strategies into its model portfolios for wealth managers. Private equity and private credit strategies have the potential to bring on higher returns but are also less liquid and more expensive investments than mutual funds or ETFs. The manager is hoping to be the builder of next-generation technology, whether that's data centers needed for artificial intelligence or infrastructure needed for decarbonization.\\n\\n\\\"We're not going to say they're alternatives because they'll just be part of the market,\\\" said BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, about private strategies, which have long been touted in industry lingo as \\\"alternatives\\\" to the public market.\\n\\nRelated stories\\n\\nFink said risk will be measured by the liquidity of these blended portfolios.

The firm's leaders said the fourth quarter is traditionally a strong one for this segment of their business, and the franchise has also seen serious inflows following political events and central bank decisions.\\n\\nComparatively, retail allocation to the private markets is in the \\\"low-single digits,\\\" according to Small, giving BlackRock another territory to expand into.\\n\\n\\\"The opportunities ahead of us have never been better than they are now,\\\" Fink said.

The following has been edited for length and clarity.\\n\\nIn 2008, I was living in Santa Cruz, California, and working on several different projects. One of these involved developing some of the first virtual-tour software.\\n\\nBack then, a virtual tour was taking two 183-degree fisheye images and stitching them together in a Java platform. That way, you could navigate the image 360 by 360.\\n\\nAt the time, I was an avid surfer of Craigslist because you could find deals on anything. In Silicon Valley, many people sold off computer gear, tech gadgets, and all sorts of electronic toys.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nI kept noticing the ship pop up on Craigslist. At first, I ignored it, but eventually, my curiosity got the better of me, and I thought it could be a great opportunity for a virtual tour.\\n\\nI was entranced by a ship for sale on Craigslist\\n\\nThe boat was docked on an island near a small Californian city named Rio Vista.\\n\\nThe first time I went aboard, I posed as a potential buyer. The boat felt creepy. It was a rusty hulk, and for many years, no power had been running through the electrical system, leaving the boat without lights.\\n\\nEven so, it had an amazing layout and beautiful staircases. It looked more like a giant yacht than a cruise ship.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nI went home thinking, \\\"What has the ship accomplished?\\\" I did not know the ship's name, so there was no way to reference it.\\n\\nA vintage picture of the Aurora cruise ship. Courtesy of Christopher Willson\\n\\nI did a massive amount of image searching and was surprised. The ship was named Wappen von Hamburg, the first ship Germany was permitted to build after World War II.\\n\\nIt was one of history's most pioneering cruise ships and no expense was spared in its creation \\u2014 down to every last detail.\\n\\nThe boat had four lounges and an area where luxury cabins once existed, though all had been removed. There was a main lounge and entry, 85 cabins, and several random rooms, including a dining area accommodating about 250 people.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nI couldn't figure out how such a beautiful ship with historical significance made it to the California Delta.\\n\\nIt was difficult to find a home for the ship\\n\\nMy first thought wasn't to purchase the boat \\u2014 which I eventually renamed Aurora \\u2014 but to assist the owner in finding a solution.\\n\\nRelated stories\\n\\nIt was illegally moored on state land, and there was a deadline for its removal that was already six months overdue.\\n\\nBack then, I didn't own the ship yet, but I was helping to find a solution and fix it. My goal was to find a safe home for the boat, which I did.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nIn late 2008, I got a one-year lease for the ship at a former Army base in Rio Vista. However, we had to figure out what to do when the lease expired.\\n\\nI eventually secured a long-term lease on Pier 38 in San Francisco in 2010.\\n\\nBy the time Willson encountered the cruise ship, the Aurora was deteriorating. Courtesy of Christopher Willson\\n\\nI purchased the boat later in 2010. (Editor's note: Willson declined to share how much he paid for the boat. In 2022, though, Willson told BI that the boat was initially listed on Craigslist for $1.2 million but that he successfully negotiated with the seller to reduce the price by half. BI hasn't independently verified the purchase price of the ship.)\\n\\nWe worked on it for months with the help of dedicated volunteers. I even moved onto the ship that year.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nHowever, months into our long-term stay, and after investing around $80,000 of my own money to build the boat's infrastructure and transport it to the pier, we found out that the pier's leaseholder had lost the pier.\\n\\nAfter he lost the pier, the Port of San Francisco wanted us out. For a while, I tried to stay and communicate with them, explaining how challenging it was to find a new location for the ship. However, a lawsuit was eventually filed to force us out.\\n\\nBy then, the volunteers working on the boat had completely stopped coming.\\n\\nA side view of the Aurora cruise ship. Courtesy of Christopher Willson\\n\\nIn 2011, we found a place to house Aurora at a Stockton, California, marina.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nWe had big ideas for Aurora. We thought it was in a safe place and wanted to get it into better condition. But ultimately, the marina owner lost the marina.\\n\\nIt felt like we were jumping from one frying pan into another.\\n\\nI ended up feeling trapped by the boat\\n\\nAfter the owner left the marina, there were a lot of situations that would temporarily stop progress on the Aurora.\\n\\nA dredging issue in the channel where the Aurora sits also made it impossible to relocate the ship. Being stuck in that situation made me question whether I was wasting my life trying to manage a mess I couldn't control.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nFor years, I felt a little bit trapped. So, in October 2023, I decided to sell the boat and move out.\\n\\nIt took me about five years to reach that decision, compounded by other issues, including a power company shutting off the marina's electricity, leading to the boats on the marina slowly experiencing issues. One vessel sank next to us, followed by another shortly after.\\n\\nInside the Aurora cruise ship. Courtesy of Christopher Willson\\n\\nI found someone who could take over the quest \\u2014 a smart and knowledgeable mechanic who had volunteered during renovations. I figured he could do it, and I wouldn't mind helping him organize fundraisers, find volunteers, and physically help with projects.\\n\\nEven though I left behind hundreds of thousands of dollars' worth of materials, furnishings, and artwork, I sold the ship to him at almost a giveaway price. It was like $20 \\u2014 more of a symbolic sale. I truly wanted him to succeed.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nBy May 2024, Aurora had also begun to sink \\u2014 about 4 to 5 feet. The new owner was absent during this time, but when he returned, he discovered a hole near the waterline.\\n\\nI'm sad the boat has been destroyed, but I'm moving on to new projects\\n\\nToday, Aurora is still at the marina, but sadly, contractors have razed the boat.\\n\\nAccording to the news, contractors took everything on Aurora, tossed it into trash bins, and called it debris.\\n\\nIt's sad to see. If we could have moved to another location with a dry dock, it would have been a permanent fixture in a nearby community.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nA run-down hallway on the boat before and after Willson bought it and made it livable again. Courtesy of Christopher Willson\\n\\nWe did so much with Aurora.\\n\\nThe main area and seven cabins were restored, and the main entryway was well on its way to completion. The lower entryway was fully finished and beautifully detailed. We also received donated furniture from the Island Princess, the ship featured in \\\"The Love Boat.\\\"\\n\\nI spent shy of $2 million of my own money fixing up the boat. Though we never asked for donations, many people contributed small amounts here and there \\u2014 I kept a record of the donations from the very beginning, which totaled around $4,500.\\n\\nThe rest of the money that went into the boat came from revenue generated by selling T-shirts, creating a YouTube channel for Aurora, and money I made doing various tech projects.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nBefore I got involved with Aurora, I spent 12 \\u00bd years as an electromechanical engineer in disaster recovery. Over the years, I earned my income through the cryptocurrency markets and continued to work in tech doing contract work. I also took part in corporate auctions for high-tech companies, buying items and reselling them online.\\n\\nA renovated room on the Aurora. Courtesy of Christopher Willson\\n\\nThe whole project morphed into something really cool for a long time. The knowledge I gained from that ship is quite impressive. I would have stayed out there and been part of that boat forever.\\n\\nI'm pretty sad about the whole situation, but I believe things happen for a reason. Although I don't regret a single minute of my time on it, I knew I needed to leave before I started to feel regret.\\n\\nIt was time to move on and start another project.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThis year, I was offered a 300-foot sailboat, but I think I'll stay on land for a while.\\n\\nI'm now looking for something like a theater or perhaps an old church to be my next project \\u2014 something historically significant with some character.\"\n",

      "            \"text\": \"The consumers powering US economic growth are increasingly those who are higher up the income ladder, and likely enjoying a wealth effect from asset-price gains, according to research by Federal Reserve economists.\\n\\nIn the two pre-pandemic years, average household consumption was growing at a similar pace across all income groups, the new Fed study of retail spending shows. But since then, spending patterns have diverged sharply.\\n\\nIn the initial Covid period through mid-2021, low-income households increased spending faster than others with the help of public stimulus programs. But their consumption fell back after the last pandemic checks went out, while middle- and especially higher-income Americans have powered ahead. Overall, since the start of 2018, high-earning households raised spending more than twice as much as the low-income group.\\n\\nThe findings cast new light on the robust US consumer demand over the last couple of years, which has surprised analysts and kept the economy growing at a faster pace than many had expected.\\n\\nThe Fed researchers find that Americans across income groups are able to spend more than they did six years ago. But they conclude that recent consumer resilience has been \\u201cdriven by middle- and high-income households,\\u201d while lower earners pulled back and \\u201conly recently recovered to their mid-2021 levels of real average retail spending.\\u201d The data in the Fed paper is adjusted for inflation.\\n\\nOne possible driver of the divergence is that higher-income households are enjoying a \\u201cwealth effect\\u201d from gains in housing and stock markets, and also \\u201creceive more interest and investment income during periods of higher interest rates, all providing a stimulus for sustained level of spending,\\u201d the Fed economists Sinem Hacioglu Hoke, Leo Feler, and Jack Chylak write.\\n\\nThe Fed\\u2019s bottom-up study of retail spending is based on numbers provided by consumer data company Numerator, which collects receipts from a panel of 150,000 representative US households. The Fed researchers say that this dataset on household spending is overall a good match for the retail sales figures that come from businesses, boosting confidence in the distributional breakdown.\\n\\nAnalyzing the numbers by demographic segments, the researchers find that retail spending has been stronger among more educated workers \\u2014 and again they find a divergence from the pre-pandemic years when the growth was more evenly distributed.\\n\\nBy housing status, the data show that renters, who tend to be lower-income, experienced the largest increase in retail spending at the onset of the pandemic, but now show the smallest overall gains since 2018.\\n\\nLonger-term homeowners who had the opportunity to lock-in low fixed-rate mortgages in 2020 and 2021 have more disposable income to sustain higher spending on goods and food services. But the study finds that Americans who bought property since 2022 \\u2014 likely paying a premium and taking on a higher debt-to-income ratio \\u2014 are not sharing in the overall spending growth.\\n\\n\\u201cReal retail spending for these recent-owner households has been declining since mid-2022 to the present, which corresponds to the time when they purchased their homes,\\u201d the Fed economists wrote.\"\n",

      "            \"text\": \"Good morning, Broadsheet readers! Emma Walmsley\\u2019s GSK is settling its Zantac lawsuits for $2.2 billion, a space startup hits a milestone, and two authors share an excerpt of their new book, Selling Sexy: Victoria\\u2019s Secret and the unraveling of an American icon.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u2013 Scaling sexy. The rise and fall of Victoria\\u2019s Secret\\u2014from a failure to keep up with a changing culture to retail titan Les Wexner\\u2019s association with Jeffrey Epstein\\u2014have been written about for years. But in their new book Selling Sexy: Victoria\\u2019s Secret and the Unraveling of an American icon, authors Lauren Sherman and Chantal Fernandez weave together the tale of the lingerie-maker\\u2019s downfall with its broader business story. Below, in an excerpt from their new book, the authors trace the company\\u2019s relative outperformance during the Great Recession\\u2014a period where much went right but the seeds of trouble to come in the 2010s were planted.\\n\\nIn 2008, the national consumer mood was gloomy and apprehensive. The United States was officially in a recession, seeing its sharpest downturn since the 1940s. Yet at the Victoria\\u2019s Secret Fashion Show, with its pop stars and models in lace, leather, and feathers, there was no evidence of that. As Victoria\\u2019s Secret angel Adriana Lima said backstage: \\u201cWhat are we supposed to do\\u2014wear cotton?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThe new sexy is glamor,\\u201d CEO Sharen Jester Turney said after the show\\u2019s eighth annual taping. Turney faced a job-defining test as the economic downturn mounted. She was the first CEO to lead all Victoria\\u2019s Secret divisions across stores, catalog, and beauty and was the third-highest-paid female executive in the U.S. with a total compensation of $20.3 million in 2008.\\n\\nMeanwhile, an average of 700,000 Americans were losing their jobs each month. And nothing kills the joy of retail therapy like the fear of not being able to make ends meet.\\n\\nThe Great Recession brought an abrupt, painful end to a golden age of American retail, built on networks of shopping malls and biannual discounts. The immediate impact was painful. Stores had little choice but to essentially give their goods away by slashing prices\\u2014a strategy with escalating consequences. In retail, the smallest slowdown in sales can be crippling. Products start to pile up. Leslie Wexner, the owner and chairman of parent company L Brands, later likened the recession to riding inside a free-falling elevator with its cable cut, plunging to unknown depths.\\n\\nBut Wexner and Turney navigated the downturn more deftly than many of their peers. Victoria\\u2019s Secret cut prices, but typically only on specific categories or collections, so as to limit the perception that the brand was in trouble. Turney also temporarily stopped selling many of the brand\\u2019s less-successful styles and smaller product lines that distracted from the best-selling collections and had smaller profit margins. Instead of languishing in Victoria\\u2019s Secret stores, those lines and other excess items were funneled to charities and discount retailers in foreign countries, sometimes with the brand\\u2019s labels removed to disguise the practice.\\n\\nWexner also had the foresight to see beyond the crisis. He insisted that none of his executives cancel product orders with their factories or stiff their stores\\u2019 landlords on rent\\u2014common tactics for retailers in jeopardy. \\u201cHe basically said, all of our competitors are going to cancel orders left, right, and backwards,\\u201d said a finance executive. \\u201cWe are going to reestablish our partnership in a very important way.\\u201d In 2009, Victoria\\u2019s Secret\\u2019s annual revenue shrank for the first time in eight years, and sales at stores open more than one year fell by 6%. Operating income fell, too, by about 5%. But the brand\\u2019s reputation remained largely intact. Consider that two years later, Kanye West and Jay-Z performed their hit song \\u201cN**gas in Paris\\u201d live on television for the very first time during the brand\\u2019s fashion show. Over 10 million people tuned in for the rap duo\\u2019s appearance, and the program had its best ratings in a decade.\\n\\nWhen Americans started shopping with gusto again, their perception of a good deal was forever warped. Shoppers expected the same level of nonstop discounts they enjoyed in 2008 and 2009, especially when buying clothing and shoes. But less so at Victoria\\u2019s Secret. The rocky economy had not deflated Americans\\u2019 obsession with an idealized version of the female body, and Victoria\\u2019s Secret\\u2019s latest launch\\u2014the \\u201cMiraculous,\\u201d later renamed the \\u201cBombshell\\u201d bra\\u2014was built with enough padding to make bust sizes appear two cups larger. The slogan \\u201cHello Bombshell\\u201d recalled the \\u201cHello Boys\\u201d Wonderbra billboards of the 1990s. The new bra became a quick bestseller, despite its nearly $50 price tag. Victoria\\u2019s Secret emerged from the recession perfectly positioned as a relatively easy indulgence. It would be nearly a decade before most of its shoppers would begin to question the value of those once reliable thrills\\u2014and learn about the troubles lurking beneath them.\\n\\nAdapted from SELLING SEXY: Victoria\\u2019s Secret and the unraveling of an American icon by Lauren Sherman and Chantal Fernandez.

She responded, \\u201cIn this crisis \\u2014 like in so many issues that affect the people of our country \\u2014 I think it so important that leadership recognizes the dignity\\u201d to which people are entitled.\\n\\n\\u201cI have to stress that this is not a time for people to play politics,\\u201d Harris added.\\n\\nThose comments came after the former president spoke at the Detroit Economic Club, offering sympathy to people affected by Hurricanes Helene and Milton, the latter of which came ashore in Florida Wednesday night. But Trump also suggested that the Biden administration\\u2019s response had been lacking, particularly in North Carolina after Helene.\\n\\n\\u201cThey\\u2019ve let those people suffer unjustly,\\u201d said Trump, who has for several days promoted falsehoods about the federal response.\\n\\nHarris virtually attended a briefing, held in the White House Situation Room with President Joe Biden, on emergency efforts in Milton\\u2019s wake. In subsequent comments to reporters, Biden slammed Trump and his supporters for spreading misinformation about federal assistance available to victims.\\n\\n\\u201cThey\\u2019re being so damn un-American with the way they\\u2019re talking about this stuff,\\u201d Biden said, then adding directly to Trump: \\u201cGet a life, man. Help these people.\\u201d\\n\\nDespite the storm, Trump and Harris are both visiting key swing states strategically, trying to increase support with key voting blocs who could decide an election expected to be exceedingly close.\\n\\nIn Michigan, where he\\u2019s looking to appeal primarily to blue-collar voters, Trump took a swipe at the city he happened to be campaigning in, suggesting that Detroit was \\u201ca mess.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cOur whole country will end up being like Detroit if she\\u2019s your president,\\u201d he said of Harris. \\u201cYou\\u2019re going to have a mess on your hands.\\u201d\\n\\nHarris responded that Trump \\u201cyet again has trashed another great American city when he was in Detroit, which is just a further piece of evidence on a very long list of why he is unfit to be president of the United States.\\u201d\\n\\nTrump\\u2019s economic speech featured multiple errors\\n\\nThe former president used his appearance at the Detroit Economic Club to echo core themes from his 2016 campaign, saying some other countries, especially China, are ripping the U.S. off and taking manufacturing business away. Trump said powerful companies have \\u201craped\\u201d the United States.\\n\\n\\u201cThey\\u2019ve been screwing us for so many years that we\\u2019re allowed to get some of that back,\\u201d Trump said about charging tariffs from countries.\\n\\nEconomists warn Trump\\u2019s proposed tariffs would drive up consumer costs. Trump has also claimed, without providing specifics, that he can use tariffs to reduce the U.S. budget deficit and pay for an expansion of childcare funding, even as he proposes other ideas without saying how he would replace the lost funding.\\n\\nBut the former president seemed to not understand the difference between the budget deficit and trade imbalances, conflating the two different economic measures as essentially being the same thing.\\n\\nHe noted that the federal government has nearly $36 trillion in total debt, a byproduct of the annual borrowing needed to cover the gap between tax revenues and government spending. Except Trump then seemed to indicate that the debt was a byproduct of the trade deficit with China \\u2014 which is a separate issue that reflects the difference between how much a country exports and how much it imports.\\n\\n\\u201cWe have $36 trillion in debt,\\u201d Trump said. \\u201cFor years and years and years, we\\u2019ve been accumulating. We\\u2019d have these deficits that are monstrous. We had 5,6,7 $800 billion deficit with China.\\u201d\\n\\nHe also claimed that \\u201cwe had the highest job numbers in my administration,\\u201d but that isn\\u2019t true any longer. The unemployment rate fell slightly lower under Biden \\u2014 to 3.4% early last year, the lowest in a half-century, below 3.5% before the pandemic under Trump.\\n\\nHarris looks to boost Hispanic support\\n\\nHarris held a rally near Phoenix after participating in the town hall for the Spanish-language network Univision. She\\u2019s looking to increase support among Hispanic voters, especially men.\\n\\nHer campaign began a group this week known as \\u201cHombres con Harris\\u201d \\u2014 Spanish for \\u201cMen for Harris\\u201d \\u2014 that is planning to hold events at Latino-owned small businesses, union halls, barbecues and community events until Election Day.\\n\\nAt Univision\\u2019s \\u201cLatinos Ask, Kamala Harris Responds\\u201d event, Ivett Castillo, 40 and a Las Vegas resident, told Harris that she\\u2019s an American citizen born to two Mexican parents and that her mother died six weeks ago. She cried as she asked the vice president about \\u201cplans to support that subgroup of immigrants here their whole lives and who live and die in the shadows.\\u201d When the town hall ended, Harris went over and clasped hands with Castillo, whose face was still streaked with tears.\\n\\nIn response to her question, Harris noted that Biden sent a bill to Congress on his first day in office seeking to create pathways to U.S. citizenship for many people in the country illegally that was never considered.\\n\\nUnauthorized border crossings hit record highs during the Biden administration before declining this year after the president issued an executive order restricting asylum claims.\\n\\nAnother audience member asked Harris to explain how she replaced Biden on the Democratic ticket, prompting her to respond, \\u201cPresident Biden made a decision that I think history will show was probably one of the most courageous a president could make.\\u201d\\n\\nShe said Biden \\u201cput country before personal interest\\u201d and \\u201curged me to run.\\u201d\\n\\nHispanic voters are about evenly split on whether to trust Harris or Trump to do a better job handling the economy, but they give the former president an edge on handling immigration. Hispanic women are more likely to trust Harris to better handle the economy and immigration, and Hispanic men are more likely to trust Trump on both issues, according to polling from The Associated Press and the NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.\\n\\nLater, in Arizona, Harris praised the late Republican Arizona Sen. John McCain for defying his party and voting to preserve the Obama administration\\u2019s signature health care law. That drew extended cheers while people in the crowd made thumbs-down gestures to signify McCain\\u2019s opposition to the GOP effort to repeal it.\\n\\n\\u201cIt was late, late, late in the night and they were trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act again,\\u201d Harris recalled of the Senate vote. \\u201cAnd the late, great John McCain, the great American war hero \\u2026 said: \\u2018No you don\\u2019t. No you don\\u2019t. No you don\\u2019t.\\u2019\\u201d\\n\\nHarris also deviated from her usual campaign speech to urge Arizonans to vote in a state referendum to safeguard abortion rights and talked about preserving tribal rights and responsible water policy.\\n\\n\\u201cI promise you as president I will continue to invest in drought resilience,\\u201d Harris said.\"\n",

      "            \"text\": \"The America we aspire to is built on the principle that everyone has a voice in shaping the future of our nation. Voting is not only a civic duty but also the most direct way to shape the country\\u2019s future. Yet, in a system where the president is determined by the Electoral College, many feel the popular vote doesn\\u2019t matter.\\n\\nI\\u2019m here to tell you\\u2014it absolutely does.\\n\\nHaving spent my career advising leaders in the private, public, and civil society sectors, I\\u2019ve witnessed how executives and officials who command the confidence of their stakeholders achieve remarkable results. As the saying goes, a leader without a strong following is just out for a walk.\\n\\nEven though the Electoral College decides the presidency, a decisive popular vote can fundamentally shift the nation\\u2019s course. We need a president with a clear mandate\\u2014one that leaves no doubt about the will of the American people. That mandate is something each voter contributes to.\\n\\nWhy the popular vote still matters\\n\\nThis election cycle narrows the focus to only a few competitive states. Presently, only about seven are considered toss-ups, leaving 43 states\\u2014and roughly 80% of the population\\u2014feeling as though their votes don\\u2019t count. Voters in states with predictable outcomes may wonder why they should bother casting a ballot. However, every vote contributes to a national mandate.\\n\\nThat mandate matters. A president who wins a strong popular vote margin gains more than a technical victory. They earn a broad, undeniable endorsement from the electorate, giving them the political capital needed to lead, legislate, and effect meaningful change. A president with clear popular support can push through major reforms, even in a divided Congress, because their mandate is an expression of collective will.\\n\\nWe\\u2019ve seen examples of this. When a president secures a popular and electoral victory, winning across many states, it solidifies their ability to govern decisively. Conversely, controversial victories where the popular vote is lost have historically hampered a presidency\\u2019s legitimacy from the start. How a president wins often determines their ability to lead.\\n\\nA mandate for change and unity\\n\\nThe challenges facing our country today are monumental. From intensifying political polarization, global conflicts, and climate change to ongoing struggles for racial and economic justice, the next president must be prepared to act boldly. But entering office without a strong popular vote could leave them facing constant political resistance, a divided public opinion, and questions about their legitimacy. A victory by millions of popular votes strengthens mandates, while a narrow Electoral College margin fuels divisions.\\n\\nA decisive popular vote win provides more than just numbers\\u2014it offers moral and political authority. It equips the president to unify the country, tackle entrenched issues, and overcome opposition. Imagine what could be achieved if a president could lead with the full backing of a majority of Americans, with a mandate to address climate change, reform healthcare, continue to build our nation\\u2019s infrastructure, or pass economic policies to reduce inequality and support small businesses and entrepreneurship.\\n\\nFrom deepening political divisions that threaten future generations to ongoing struggles with injustice, targeted discrimination, economic inequality, and acts of hate and intolerance, our disparate and diverse nation needs to unify.\\n\\nOvercoming cynicism and apathy\\n\\nWhen we give in to cynicism and apathy, we surrender our power.\\n\\nIf many voters across the country stay home, believing their votes don\\u2019t matter, we would risk letting a few small margins in the Electoral College determine our future, silencing the broader voice of the popular vote.\\n\\nHistory tells us that a surge in voter engagement signals change and opportunity.\\n\\nThe stakes are higher in this election\\n\\nThis election is a pivotal moment in American history. The choices are stark, and the stakes are enormous. The next few years will define our response to issues like economic recovery, climate action, reproductive rights, and criminal justice reform. They will answer critical questions about who we are as a nation and what values we stand for.\\n\\nThe popular vote provides a powerful answer to those questions. It reflects the will of all Americans\\u2014not just those in battleground states\\u2014and strengthens the democratic process. Whether you live in New York, Texas, or Idaho, your vote contributes to the broader mandate that defines the future of our country.\\n\\nNo matter where you live or who you vote for, your participation is vital. The strength of our democracy rests on the engagement of its people. We need a president with not just the numbers to win, but the overwhelming support to lead with clarity and purpose.\\n\\nThe popular vote may not directly decide the presidency, but it shapes the mandate\\u2014and that mandate rests with us all.\\n\\nThe Electoral College decides\\u2014but the popular vote matters.\\n\\nMore must-read commentary published by Fortune:\\n\\nThe opinions expressed in Fortune.com commentary pieces are solely the views of their authors and do not necessarily reflect the opinions and beliefs of Fortune.\"\n",

After two years of battling inflation, the Federal Reserve finally claimed victory. More rate cuts were coming, which meant lower borrowing costs for everyone.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nBut the relief many were hoping for isn't materializing , writes Business Insider's Jennifer Sor. Let's break down why.\\n\\nWe finally got an interest-rate cut, but borrowing costs are still high. What gives? First off, last month's interest-rate cut wasn't going to provide immediate relief. It takes time for cuts to trickle down to consumers. The Fed also telegraphed the cut, so the market started pricing it in.\\n\\nThat seems fair, but borrowing rates are still rising in some cases. Yes, the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate has gone up 47 basis points since the Fed cut rates , writes BI's Matthew Fox.\\n\\nSo the Fed cut rates but borrowing costs went up? How is that possible? You can thank the 10-year Treasury yield, which is a key benchmark used by lenders. It went above 4% this week for the first time since August.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nI'm confused. Why is there such a discrepancy between the two? The Fed's rate is focused on the short-term while the 10-year Treasury reflects a longer-term view (hence the name). As a result, the 10-year bond yield can diverge from the Fed's benchmark rate.\\n\\nGulp So what does the 10-year Treasury rising mean for the economy? Big picture, it's a good thing. Thanks to a stellar jobs report, investors have a positive view of the economy's future. But the downside is we shouldn't expect the slew of rate cuts investors were banking on. The economy will likely avoid a recession and not need the help.\\n\\nIs this a soft landing or a hard landing? Neither. It's considered a \\\"no landing\\\" because the economy remains strong, but in a way that risks reigniting inflation, which would hamstring the prospect of future stimulative rate cuts.\\n\\nWhat's with all the aviation metaphors? I don't know.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nOK, so at this rate, will I ever be able to buy a house? It's honestly not as bad as it seems. BI's James Rodriguez, who's covered the housing market for a while, has a piece on why the industry's ice age is starting to thaw . There was a 34% year-over-year increase in active listings in September. More inventory will help unstick the economy.\\n\\nNews brief\\n\\nTop headlines\\n\\n3 things in markets\\n\\nWarren Faidley/Getty Images\\n\\nThe Hurricane Milton trade is in full effect, according to US natural gas futures. Energy traders are betting the storm barreling toward Tampa will cause power outages in multiple states. Futures on US natural gas have dropped 8% over the past few days as power plants are expected to be left idling as demand evaporates. A short-seller takes aim at Roblox for \\\"lying to investors.\\\" Hindenburg Research accused the online gaming platform of inflating its user numbers by including bots and players with multiple accounts. It also called Roblox a \\\"pedophile hellscape,\\\" claiming child users are exposed to grooming and pornography. A Roblox spokesperson said in a statement it \\\"totally\\\" rejected the claims made in the report. Bank of America is bullish on stock gains ahead of this earnings season. \\\"The bar isn't high,\\\" BofA analysts said in a Tuesday note. Stocks should rise as long as companies report they're feeling good about lower rates .\\n\\n3 things in tech\\n\\nErin Beach; Chelsea Jia Feng/BI\\n\\nOpenAI's exec exodus might actually be a good thing, Vinod Khosla says. The legendary investor backing OpenAI has plenty of confidence in the startup , even after multiple high-profile exits. He also thinks the AI industry is catching strays from \\\"Luddites\\\" \\u2014 those who think the tech is a slippery slope into a Westworld-ian apocalypse. The DOJ may seek to break up Google. After a major antitrust lawsuit against Google, a federal judge ruled that it illegally monopolized online search. Now, prosecutors are proposing \\\"behavioral and structural remedies.\\\" If enacted by a judge, the changes could force a major reorganization or even a breakup of some of Google's basic businesses, including its search engine. Where are the Gen Z Mark Zuckerbergs? Gen Zers, aged 13 to 27, haven't produced any big-name tech founders like previous generations.

Zara.com; Rebecca Zisser/BI\\n\\nZara's bizarre website is the secret to its success. The site, which feels more like a magazine spread than an online retailer, is routinely roasted for being \\\"virtually unusable.\\\" But experts say there's a method to Zara's madness : It's meant to project an upscale image, distancing itself from other fast-fashion brands. The \\\"happiest place on earth\\\" takes a rain check. There are literally storm clouds forming over Florida's family-friendly amusement parks, as the state braces for Hurricane Milton. It's a rare occasion for Disney World , which has only closed its gates nine times in more than 50 years. Tesla executives are hitting the exits. In the past week, four of Elon Musk's direct reports have announced they're leaving , or have already left, the company.

And, he added, the state's Department of Transportation alone has collected more than 1,200 truckloads of debris, totaling 22,000 cubic yards, in just the past 48 hours.\\n\\nNick Friedman, the cofounder of College HUNKS Hauling Junk & Moving said after Helene, \\\"it felt like a war zone in the subsequent days where literally everybody's belongings in their homes was out on the curb because their homes flooded.\\\"\\n\\nFriedman's company, which has 200 franchise locations around the US but is headquartered in Tampa, was hired by the city of Tampa to help with the debris removal efforts.\\n\\n\\\"People who had spent their lifetimes in Tampa said they've never experienced something like this,\\\" Friedman told Business Insider.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nJust as people were starting to get their bearings and spring into action to clean up the mess, Friedman said, then the second storm was forecast.\\n\\n\\\"And so people started really scrambling because I would say every other home you passed had a pile of at least a garage's worth of stuff out on their curb,\\\" Friedman said.\\n\\nRelated stories\\n\\nFriedman's company has been operating 50 of its own junk and moving trucks since being hired by the city, collecting roughly 2 million pounds of debris a day, he estimated.\\n\\nAll that debris gets dumped into landfills that are required to be open 24 hours a day, DeSantis said Tuesday.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nNow, it's even more urgent to get the junk out of the way before Milton strikes, Marla Spence-Howell, the communications coordinator for Tampa's Solid Waste and Environmental Program Management, told BI.\\n\\nAny debris \\u2014 fallen trees, drywall, appliances, broken furniture, cabinets, mattresses, for example \\u2014 that's left out on the streets when Milton hits has the potential to cause major hazards.\\n\\n\\\"With a hundred-plus mile winds, those things will turn into projectiles and get strewn all about,\\\" Friedman said, adding, \\\"It certainly isn't going to be safe if that stuff hits your house or hits the window. It creates certainly a safety hazard. But it's definitely going to be a messy, messy, messy cleanup process.\\\"\\n\\nIt's not just hurricane-force winds that can make the debris more dangerous \\u2014 flooding too can pick up objects and whip them around, Jeffrey Schlegelmilch, a research scholar and director for the National Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia Climate School, told BI.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\\"Debris removal is one of the biggest expenses in the early stages of recovery because you just have massive amounts of damage and stuff,\\\" Schlegelmilch said. \\\"And then you imagine another storm coming through.\\\"\\n\\nThat creates a compounding effect that makes everything more expensive \\u2014 and more dangerous, Schlegelmilch said.\\n\\nIn the hardest hit regions of the state, debris removal will continue around the clock \\\"until it's no longer safe to do so,\\\" DeSantis said Tuesday.\"\n",

Yet the move illustrates the urgency of Northvolt\\u2019s strains, while it also risks vexing suppliers who won\\u2019t be able to collect on money owed.\\n\\nThe company said it continues to work on a strategic review aimed at strengthening its core business.\\n\\n\\u201cWe are in the middle of a financing process, and we plan to return with more information later on,\\u201d the company said.\\n\\nThe filing in Sweden marks a deepening of the crisis at Northvolt, which has received about $10 billion in debt and equity funding since being founded in 2017.\\n\\nThe plan to expand at Northvolt Ett was suspended last month as part of a package of wider measures to stabilize the company\\u2019s finances. The battery maker drew major backing from governments, customers and investors as it sought to stand up an independent European supply chain for electric vehicles.\\n\\nNow Northvolt faces a cash crunch, after a production ramp-up faltered at its main plant near the Arctic Circle. Bloomberg reported last week that the company has also pulled back on an aggressive expansion across Europe and North America, as it sought to build the manufacturing scale needed to compete with lower-cost Chinese producers.\\n\\nSlowing EV demand in key markets this year has also dimmed the outlook for Northvolt.\\n\\nWhile the unit that filed for bankruptcy had no direct employees, it carried liabilities including 606 million Swedish kronor ($58.2 million) of debt to suppliers, 325 million kronor to companies within the group and 554 million kronor in accruals and deferred income, according to its latest annual report at the end of 2023.

That's a healthy balance sheet.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nLakos-Bujas is also encouraged by solid corporate earnings growth, which is expected to accelerate from 3% over the past two years to 12% over the next two years.\\n\\n\\\"US corporates have been increasingly focused on recycling pre-tax income into investment spending rather than returning after-tax profits to shareholders through buybacks, which is also helping to stimulate the economy,\\\" Lakos-Bujas explained.\\n\\nPart of that has been driven by the AI tech boom, with mega-cap tech companies expected to accelerate their R&D and capex investments to more than $500 billion per year.\\n\\n\\\"In our view, these drivers, along with US Exceptionalism, are helping offset the uneven macro weakness,\\\" Lakos-Bujas said.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nHe added: \\\"While it is too soon to assume that this is a turning point, it does suggest that a recession is unlikely in the near term, especially since surprisingly strong job growth and a downtick in the unemployment rate broke a slowing trend in the job market.\\\"\\n\\nBut Lakos-Bujas didn't turn completely bullish on stocks. The strategist warned that the November Presidential election could inject volatility into markets depending on the outcome, and lower interest rates could represent a headwind for corporate profits, particularly in the financial sector.\"\n",

In an interview on Bloomberg TV on Friday, he called the move a \\u201cconfiscation\\u201d and said it\\u2019s one of the top two biggest financial mistakes in the 21st century.\\n\\n\\u201cIt may make sense from a justice standpoint, but you\\u2019ve got to remember, it\\u2019s not going to encourage people to invest in the system,\\u201d Taleb warned.\\n\\nThe dollar remains dominant as a method of payment, and is used in 88% of foreign exchange transactions.\\n\\nBut its position as the top reserve currency has been eroded. While the trend has been going on for decades, with the greenback accounting for 58% today versus 71% in 2000, the sanctions on Russia sparked a rush to alternatives.\\n\\nGold in particular has been snapped up by central banks around the world as they look to diversify away from the dollar.\\n\\n\\u201cSo I\\u2019m really afraid of a progressive loss of the role of the dollar,\\u201d Taleb said, adding that \\u201cpeople nominally conduct transactions in dollars, but they don\\u2019t store it in dollars, and that is what the problem is.\\u201d\\n\\nThis de-dollarization trend comes as the U.S. government is going deeper into debt, with interest expenses alone skyrocketing and worsening the budget deficit.\\n\\nAs federal spending continues to far outpace revenue, the Treasury Department must issue greater volumes of bonds, many of which are bought by foreign investors. But if they\\u2019re worried about the safety of dollar-denominated assets, will they keep financing U.S. debt?\\n\\n\\u201cThat\\u2019s exactly why I\\u2019m afraid,\\u201d Taleb added. \\u201cI\\u2019m afraid of what the current administration has done in 2022 when they confiscated assets. It doesn\\u2019t encourage people to invest in your currency.\\u201d\\n\\nHe said later, \\u201cThat is harming the United States enormously.\\u201d\\n\\nTaleb, who serves as distinguished scientific advisor at Mark Spitznagel\\u2019s Universa Investments, also warned markets are more fragile than they have been at any point in the past 20 to 30 years.\\n\\nHe cited the handful of tech giants that have driven the S&P 500\\u2019s rally on AI hopes. While AI in general could turn out to be a great investment opportunity, the companies that have been surging may not be the ones that represent the sector\\u2019s long-term growth, he explained.\\n\\nThe current environment is similar to what existed during previous collapses, Taleb said, pointing to complacency in the market and the earlier era of low rates that taught people to avoid conservative investments.\\n\\nNow, valuations are \\u201ccrazy\\u201d and built on a lot of hope, while the economy looks \\u201cvery confusing\\u201d as data have been sending mixed signals lately.\\n\\nSimilarly, his colleague Spitznagel warned recently that the uninversion of the yield curve after years of being inverted, is the opening signal for big reversals down the line as a recession nears.\\n\\n\\u201cThat\\u2019s when you enter black swan territory,\\u201d he told Bloomberg TV last month. \\u201cBlack swans always lurk, but now we\\u2019re in their territory.\\u201d\"\n",

      "            \"text\": \"As Boeing Co. lurches from one crisis to the next, there\\u2019s been one constant for the embattled planemaker: Its predicament appears to be only getting worse.\\n\\nFrom a freak accident that blew a door-size hole into the fuselage of an airborne 737 Max to revelations of sloppy workmanship and now a crippling strike entering its second month \\u2014 the icon of US manufacturing hasn\\u2019t been able to catch a break since the first days of January. Cash is dwindling, plane production is anemic and the stock is heading for its worst annual performance since the financial crisis in 2008.\\n\\nCombined, the episodes have exposed quality lapses at Boeing and its supply chain, alongside a corrosive culture a quarter-century in the making, where pressure over costs and schedule permeated decision-making. Earlier this year, customers finally revolted and the board shook up leadership, hiring Kelly Ortberg in August out of retirement to fix the beleaguered manufacturer.\\n\\nIn his two months on the job, Ortberg has made a series of blunt moves. He removed the head of the defense and space division and tried to short-circuit a strike by taking a higher offer directly to workers \\u2014 a move that backfired and only hardened the union\\u2019s resolve.\\n\\nCore Areas\\n\\nHis latest maneuver came late on Friday, when Ortberg said Boeing would cut 10% of its workforce, equivalent to about 17,000 people. And he tucked in a hint that more dramatic steps might be needed to get the company back on course.\\n\\n\\u201cWe need to be clear-eyed about the work we face and realistic about the time it will take to achieve key milestones on the path to recovery,\\u201d the Boeing chief wrote in the Oct. 11 memo to workers. \\u201cWe also need to focus our resources on performing and innovating in the areas that are core to who we are.\\u201d\\u2019\\n\\nThe comments suggest that Boeing under Ortberg may double down on the field for which it is best known: Commercial aviation. The unceremonious departure of Ted Colbert as head of the defense and space business put those subsidiary\\u2019s shortcomings into sharp relief \\u2014 made more glaring still on Friday when Boeing said the unit would have about $2 billion in charges in the third quarter.\\n\\nIt all adds up to the perception of a company that will need more time to regain its footing \\u2014 the Federal Aviation Administration\\u2019s top official has said it\\u2019s a matter of years, not months, before Boeing is stabilized. When Ortberg, 64, hosts his first earnings call as CEO on Oct. 23, investors will want more detail on how he intends to comprehensively lead one of the toughest revivals in corporate America, rather than just putting out fires.\\n\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s all getting a bit hand to mouth,\\u201d said Nick Cunningham, an analyst at Agency Partners LLP in London. \\u201cIt is not a coherent plan as such, it is just another quarter of large charges, all of a kind the previous management would have had to make anyway, as they reflect existing and developing problems and are not part of a restructuring as such.\\u201d\\n\\nRating agencies have put Boeing on notice with a warning that it may slip below investment grade, a move that would make the planemaker the biggest so-called fallen angel in corporate US history. The company has only a small buffer on top of the $10 billion of cash and short-term securities that it needs to avoid slipping to jut status. The toll from the strike increases the urgency to tap markets sooner rather than later for fresh financing.\\n\\nContinuous Loop\\n\\n\\u201cFor every problem that\\u2019s come to a head, then severed, more problems sprout up,\\u201d Ron Epstein, an analyst with Bank of America, wrote in a note to clients. \\u201cThe issues all feed into each other, creating a continuous doom loop while compounding the negative impacts.\\u201d\\n\\nRead More: Boeing Said to Weigh Raising at Least $10 Billion in Stock\\n\\nAll told, Boeing will record $5 billion in combined charges for its two largest businesses when it formally reports third-quarter earnings, the company said Friday evening in a surprise announcement. Besides the defense and space charges, Boeing will book additional costs for pushing back its 777X model once more, leaving its largest widebody aircraft with a delay of about six years.\\n\\nMuch is unclear about Boeing\\u2019s turnaround efforts. The ramp-up in production that was supposed to help cash flow has been undercut by the recent strike, and the defense and space business continues to hemorrhage money.\\n\\nThe company still needs to buy back Spirit AeroSystems Holdings Inc., which it had hived off in an ill-fated move almost two decades ago, only to see manufacturing quality at its key supplier suffer as a result.\\n\\nLonger-term, Boeing may need to make some tough calls on unprofitable areas like its space endeavors. The division made global headlines a few weeks ago when its Starliner capsule returned to earth without humans on board. It was an ignominious end to its first crewed mission to orbit after NASA decided not to risk putting two astronauts back into the glitch-prone spacecraft.\\n\\nOrtberg hasn\\u2019t done any media interviews since taking over, although he\\u2019s reached out to customers, regulators, Pentagon officials and toured Boeing factories. An engineer by training, Ortberg spent most of his career at what is now known as Collins Aerospace, a well-regarded avionics equipment manufacturer that\\u2019s a key supplier to Boeing.\\n\\nAs CEO, Ortberg has appealed to a sense of camaraderie and shared destiny with the workforce. He made a point about relocating to Seattle from West Palm Beach, Florida, in a departure from his predecessor, who largely ran the company from the other side of the continent.\\n\\nCash Drain\\n\\nWhen the strike started in mid September, the CEO urged workers to embrace the future and not hold grudges, a nod to a 2014 contract that cost them their pensions. Senior management took solidarity pay reductions when Ortberg announced furloughs to preserve cash, and the latest job cuts will also include executives and management, he said.\\n\\nRead More: Boeing Union Balks at Sweetened Pay Offer to Workers\\n\\nBut with so-called touch labor accounting for less than 5% for the total cost of a commercial aircraft program, some observers wonder why Boeing isn\\u2019t moving with more urgency to end the work stoppage that\\u2019s adding to its financial distress.\\n\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s not a needle mover in terms of Boeing profitability,\\u201d said Ken Herbert, analyst with RBC Capital Markets. \\u201cWhat are we waiting for here? Every day that goes by, it\\u2019s more disruptive and more of a cash drain.\\u201d\\n\\nThe strike is cascading through Boeing\\u2019s supply chain, heightening the risk that the recovery in the planemaker\\u2019s own factories will be slow and halting even once workers are back on the job. And so far, Boeing hasn\\u2019t said where the workforce cuts will occur, or what they might cost the company in terms of severance.\\n\\n\\u2018Can\\u2019t Win\\u2019\\n\\nAnnouncing the job cuts in the middle of labor negotiations is also a strategy fraught with risk.\\n\\nOn the one hand, Ortberg wants to instill a sense of urgency and shared sacrifice, said George Ferguson, an analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence. But on the other hand, the move threatens further antagonizing the very workers Boeing needs to restart jetliner production, at a time when skilled mechanics are in high demand.\\n\\nEven before Friday\\u2019s announcement, the war of words had intensified. Both Boeing and the union filed formal complaints accusing the other of breaching the protocol for labor negotiations.\\n\\n\\u201cHe can\\u2019t win without the union,\\u201d Ferguson said of Ortberg. \\u201cHe needs their heart and soul when they come back to the floor. If there was a honeymoon for the CEO, it seems to be over.\\u201d\"\n",

It\\u2019s a signed cartoon painting of three executives in the parking lot of a branch of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), all chasing little Dr. Seuss characters with \\u201cYield 1\\u201d and \\u201cYield 2\\u201d written on them.\\n\\nA reminder: SVB famously failed in March of 2023, at least in part, because it chased yield.\\n\\nPictured are all former employees of SVB Financial Group, SVB\\u2019s parent company, including two who worked at the bank during the time of its collapse. In the center is Michael Descheneaux, SVB\\u2019s CFO from 2007 to 2017 and president thereafter until the bank\\u2019s failure. On the left is Michael Kruse, SVB\\u2019s global treasurer from July 2010 to December 2022, and then a subsidiary CFO until March 2023. And on the right is Jeffrey Palmer, director of quantitative finance at SVB from February 2009 to March 2013, and now a partner at PwC.\\n\\nDescheneaux gave this painting to Felda Hardymon, a veteran venture capitalist who spent the majority of his career at Bessemer Venture Partners, after Hardymon retired from SVB\\u2019s board and finance committee in 2011. In an interview with Fortune, Hardymon claimed the painting was a joke about how he was always reminding SVB\\u2019s leadership not to chase yield when he was on the finance committee in the 2000s and early 2010s.\\n\\n\\u201cI can confirm that in the finance committee we were often pushing back on ideas to use deposits, to invest deposits in a more aggressive manner. Let me just put it that way,\\u201d he said.\\n\\nAbout a decade later, SVB invested heavily in long-term bonds that offered slightly higher yields instead of safer short-term options, seeking a better return on investment from their deposits\\u2014\\u201cchasing yield.\\u201d Then, when interest rates rose in 2022, the value of those long bonds plummeted, resulting in significant losses that made the bank unable to cover its deposits, sparking a bank run in the spring of 2023.\\n\\nWhile regulators, skittish depositors, and the Federal Reserve\\u2019s rapid rate hikes have all been blamed for SVB\\u2019s collapse, Hardymon and Ken Wilcox\\u2014who spent 30 years at SVB, including a decade as CEO between 2001 and 2011\\u2014both had a simpler explanation.\\n\\nAs Wilcox put it in an interview with Fortune: \\u201cI just think it was bad judgment \\u2026 which is the polite way of saying stupid.\\u201d\\n\\nA legal representative for Michael Kruse declined to comment. Michael Descheneaux and his legal reps did not respond to requests for comment. Jeffrey Palmer did not respond to Fortune\\u2019s request for comment.\\n\\nNeither Hardymon nor Wilcox worked at SVB during its collapse, and they don\\u2019t claim to have inside knowledge of the reasoning behind management\\u2019s decisions near the time of its downfall. But they both believe SVB\\u2019s underlying business model was sound and that its leadership chased yield at the wrong time, ultimately leading to the bank\\u2019s collapse. Furthermore, Wilcox and Hardymon noted this risk was well known by many of the bank\\u2019s leaders, at least at one time. After all, it seemed to be a running joke for some of them.\\n\\nHere\\u2019s another image to illustrate Hardymon\\u2019s point that conversations about chasing yield were common at SVB. It\\u2019s a photo of a polo shirt that was made for members of SVB\\u2019s finance committee back in 2011 by Descheneaux. It says: \\u201cSVB Financial Group Finance Committee \\u2018We will not chase yield.\\u2019\\u201d\\n\\nFelda Hardymon\\n\\nCEO-on-CEO\\n\\nWilcox stepped down from his position as SVB CEO in 2011 in order to focus on the bank\\u2019s global expansion, becoming president and vice chairman of SPD Silicon Valley Bank, SVB\\u2019s joint-venture bank in Shanghai. He then cut ties with SVB altogether at the end of 2019, and now works as a member of the advisory board at Columbia Lake Partners, a London-based venture debt investor.\\n\\nAfter Wilcox left SVB, he proudly watched his successor, Gregory Becker, lean into a tech lending strategy and grow the bank into a behemoth with over $200 billion in assets. Then came the collapse.\\n\\nNow, Wilcox says he\\u2019s frustrated after spending years \\u201cnurturing\\u201d Becker, only for him and his team to make critical errors that Wilcox says helped spark the downfall of SVB.\\n\\nThe veteran banker detailed the last time he talked to his successor, which was some nine months ago. \\u201cI was upset, and my basic line of thought was: \\u2018Why would the bank do that?\\u2019 Because it just doesn\\u2019t make sense to me,\\u201d he said, referencing SVB\\u2019s decision to chase yield.\\n\\nWilcox said his theory is that bankers should focus on things that are at least somewhat predictable, but Becker and his team instead ended up making a risky bet on something that can never be predicted.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u201cIn other words, if you want a loan from me, I can analyze the situation \\u2026 And I can come to an educated guess, a probabilistically positive prediction around: Will you pay me back or not?\\u201d he explained. \\u201cBut guessing on the direction of interest rates, I firmly believe\\u2014and I mean this metaphorically\\u2014only God knows where interest rates are going.\\u201d\\n\\nAccording to Wilcox, Becker responded to this critique by saying that since inflation and interest rates had been low for over a decade, he didn\\u2019t expect them to rise again anytime soon. In his written testimony to the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, Becker also pointed to the Fed\\u2019s \\u201ctransitory\\u201d inflation call as a reason why SVB\\u2019s management believed an era of ultralow interest rates would continue.\\n\\nBecker declined to comment publicly on these claims through his legal representation, which cited pending court cases for the decision.\\n\\nOf course, hindsight is 20/20, but Wilcox believes this bet on interest rates was an obvious mistake.\\n\\nChasing yield and other missteps\\n\\nBy the end of 2022, SVB had invested more than 90% of its held-to-maturity securities portfolio in mortgage-backed securities, municipal bonds, and Treasuries with maturities of over 10 years. It was a big risk, all for a paltry 1.63% return. They certainly could have opted for shorter-term securities (like Treasury bills) that didn\\u2019t offer as much yield, but also wouldn\\u2019t have been as susceptible to changes in interest rates.\\n\\nAs the Fed raised interest rates the value of SVB\\u2019s long-term holdings quickly fell, leaving the bank with billions in unrealized losses and a liquidity problem that ultimately sparked a bank run. In other words, their investment went bad, and they needed more money to operate.\\n\\nThere were other conditions and mistakes that made SVB\\u2019s collapse possible. The lack of proper regulatory oversight, the rapid social-media-driven depositor flight, and even the Federal Reserve\\u2019s quick turn to aggressive interest rate hikes have been blamed for SVB\\u2019s collapse. But Brian Graham, a partner at Klaros Group, told Fortune that none of these issues would have mattered if it weren\\u2019t for SVB\\u2019s decision to invest deposits in debt securities with long maturities that lost much of their value when rates rose.\\n\\n\\u201cWhen you look at the Silicon Valley scenario, it\\u2019s pretty clear, right? What they had were these very significant unrealized losses in their securities,\\u201d said Graham, formerly the CEO of BancAlliance, a network of more than 300 community banks. \\u201cIf they did not have those kinds of losses, they would have been fine.\\u201d\\n\\nWilcox believes it wasn\\u2019t just SVB\\u2019s decision to chase yield that caused issues either. Part of the reason the bank collapsed was management\\u2019s failure to control the growth of its deposits relative to its loans.\\n\\nBy keeping deposits appropriately sized in relation to the loans, Wilcox argued that SVB would have been able to cope with withdrawals from VCs and tech startups in the market downturn of 2022 much better, allowing them to avoid raising capital, which was what ultimately spooked SVB\\u2019s clients and led to a bank run. Hardymon backed up this claim, based on his experience as a former SVB board member and as a venture capitalist at Bessemer Venture Partners.\\n\\nWilcox and Hardymon also pointed to risk management issues, arguing SVB failed to keep its risk management team appropriately sized as the bank grew. SVB famously didn\\u2019t have a chief risk officer for eight months before it collapsed.\\n\\nThe pair said that regulators should bear some blame for SVB\\u2019s collapse as well.\\n\\n\\u201cBy God, the regulators, practically\\u2014when you\\u2019re as big as they were in 2023\\u2014they\\u2019re living with you, and they know everything you\\u2019re doing,\\u201d Wilcox said, adding: \\u201cThey knew, trust me, that the long-term bond portfolio was growing \\u2026 So why didn\\u2019t they tell Greg?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u2018Sad days\\u2019\\n\\nAfter years of warnings and inside jokes about chasing yield, crisis finally struck SVB on March 10, 2023.\\n\\nJust two days later, Hardymon received a message from Descheneaux. It read simply: \\u201cSad days.\\u201d The former SVB board member\\u2019s response? \\u201cYes. Shouldn\\u2019t have chased yields. Hope you are okay.\\u201d Descheneaux didn\\u2019t respond.\\n\\nFelda Hardymon\\n\\nDescheneaux and Hardymon appear to have maintained a friendship over the years despite the tension over jokes about chasing yield, based on text messages seen by Fortune.\\n\\nEven after SVB collapsed and Hardymon had openly criticized him, Descheneaux sent an image to his old friend. It was a picture, with a laughing face emoji, from the time when Hardymon had done Descheneaux a favor by teaching a few classes at Texas A&M\\u2019s Innovation Center in 2013.\\n\\nDon\\u2019t blame the business model\\u2014we still need it\\n\\nWhy are these former SVB leaders speaking out now, more than a year and a half after the bank\\u2019s collapse? The simple answer is they believe that their bank\\u2019s business model\\u2014which has drawn criticism from Fed officials, politicians, and more\\u2014is worth saving.\\n\\nSVB\\u2019s tech-focused lending strategies, which proved successful for decades, had little to do with the bank\\u2019s collapse, they said.\\n\\n\\u201cThe problem here was not the business. The problem here was a stupid mistake followed by the failure of seven lines of defense,\\u201d Wilcox said. \\u201cSo wouldn\\u2019t it make much more sense to continue financing the technology industry and quit making stupid mistakes \\u2026 instead of ending the story by blaming it on the business model?\\u201d\\n\\nHardymon echoed that view, arguing SVB\\u2019s tech-startup lending\\u2014which involved taking risks on pre-revenue startups, and offering advisory services to help them progress\\u2014was one of the U.S.\\u2019s great \\u201cstrategic advantages\\u201d over its peers. \\u201cYou need it. It\\u2019s the glue that makes an innovation economy work,\\u201d he said.\\n\\nQuestions about the viability of SVB\\u2019s tech-startup-focused business model were quick to surface after its collapse. A number of senators argued that SVB\\u2019s core business just wasn\\u2019t viable. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) called it an \\u201cobviously risky structure,\\u201d and said it was \\u201cfrankly shocking\\u201d that regulators had even allowed it in an open letter to San Francisco Fed president Mary Daly. And experts jumped on the business-model-bashing bandwagon almost immediately as well.\\n\\nBut it was the Fed\\u2019s rebuke of SVB\\u2019s business model that really upset the bank\\u2019s former leaders. In Michael Barr\\u2019s review of SVB\\u2019s collapse, the Fed\\u2019s point man on bank supervision said that SVB\\u2019s \\u201chighly concentrated business model\\u201d was one of the key reasons for its downfall.\\n\\n\\u201cI think that was a cheap shot,\\u201d said Wilcox, who worked at the San Francisco branch of the Federal Reserve earlier in his career.\\n\\nWilcox explained that 25 or 30 years ago, before SVB expanded its tech lending game, you might have been able to argue that having technology companies as your only clients was a concentration risk, because tech businesses weren\\u2019t as diverse then.\\n\\n\\u201cToday, technology is diverse. It permeates the entire economy, and I think there was definitely sufficient diversity in our loan portfolio,\\u201d he argued.\\n\\nWilcox was famously responsible for shifting SVB\\u2019s lending strategy in the early 2000s. The bank originally loaned money to real estate companies, small businesses (mostly churches, oddly enough), and tech startups, using what it called a three-legged stool strategy. But Wilcox decided to specialize, shifting SVB to a purely tech-focused lender to take advantage of employees\\u2019 connections in Silicon Valley.\\n\\nThe move ushered in a new era of growth for SVB. In 2001, the bank had just over $4 billion in assets, but by 2011, when Wilcox stepped down as CEO, it had roughly $20 billion. Given this success, the veteran banker said he would do the same thing all over again.\\n\\nWilcox went on to argue that the loss of SVB has left the U.S.\\u2019s tech-lending ecosystem ailing, and that will\\u2014at least on the margin\\u2014hamper the industry\\u2019s growth for years to come.\\n\\nTo his point, as the Financial Times reported earlier this year, Silicon Valley Bank hasn\\u2019t been replaced with another similarly tech-friendly, one-stop-shop bank. And those that have tried to take on the role haven\\u2019t had the appetite to invest in startups that don\\u2019t yet have revenue, or are losing money, like SVB did for decades with (mostly) great success.\\n\\nFor Wilcox, that\\u2019s evidence that his bank provided an invaluable service that helped boost U.S. productivity, and he believes that\\u2019s something worth defending.\\n\\n\\u201cI think [the loss of SVB is] a crying shame, and not just because so many individual people were hurt, but there\\u2019s a hole in the financial services system right now,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI don\\u2019t think the Federal Reserve, or the regulators in general, are going to let any bank operate like SVB used to operate \\u2026 That puts us at a competitive disadvantage internationally.\\u201d\"\n",

Among them was Daniel Thornton and his 9-year-old daughter Magnolia, who arrived at the station at 7 a.m. and were still waiting four hours later.\\n\\n\\u201cThey told me they have gas coming but they don\\u2019t know when it\\u2019s going to be here,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI have no choice. I have to sit here all day with her until I get gas.\\u201d\\n\\nGov. Ron DeSantis told reporters Saturday morning that the state opened three fuel distribution sites and planned to open several more. Residents can get 10 gallons (37.85 liters) each, free of charge, he said.\\n\\n\\u201cObviously as power gets restored \\u2026 and the Port of Tampa is open, you\\u2019re going to see the fuel flowing. But in the meantime, we want to give people another option,\\u201d DeSantis said.\\n\\nOfficials were replenishing area gas stations with the state\\u2019s fuel stockpiles and provided generators to stations that remained without power.\\n\\nDisaster hits twice\\n\\nThose who reached home were assessing the damage and beginning the arduous cleaning process. Some, like Bill O\\u2019Connell, a board member at Bahia Vista Gulf in Venice, had thought they were done after the condo association hired companies to gut, treat and dry the units following Hurricane Helene. Milton undid that work and caused additional damage, O\\u2019Connell said.\\n\\n\\u201cIt reflooded everything that was already flooded, brought all the sand back on our property that we removed,\\u201d O\\u2019Connell said. \\u201cAnd also did some catastrophic wind damage, ripped off many roofs and blew out a lot of windows that caused more damage inside the units.\\u201d\\n\\nThe two hurricanes left a ruinous mess in the fishing village of Cortez, a community of 4,100 along the northern edge of Sarasota Bay. Residents of its modest, single-story wood and stucco-fronted cottages were working to remove broken furniture and tree limbs, stacking the debris in the street much like they did after Hurricane Helene.\\n\\n\\u201cEverything is shot,\\u201d said Mark Praught, a retired street sweeper for Manatee County, who saw 4-foot (1.2-meter) storm surges during Helene. \\u201cWe\\u2019ll replace the electrical and the plumbing and go from there.\\u201d\\n\\nPraught and his wife, Catherine, have lived for 36 years in a low-lying home that now looks like an empty shell. All the furniture had to be discarded, the walls and the brick and tile floors had be scrubbed clean of muck, and drywall had to be ripped out.\\n\\nCatherine Praught said they felt \\u201cpure panic\\u201d when Hurricane Milton menaced Cortez so soon after Helene, forcing them to pause their cleanup and evacuate. Fortunately, their home wasn\\u2019t damaged by the second storm.\\n\\n\\u201cThis is where we live,\\u201d Catherine Praught said. \\u201cWe\\u2019re just hopeful we get the insurance company to help us.\\u201d\\n\\nIn Bradenton Beach, Jen Hilliard scooped up wet sand mixed with rocks and tree roots and dumped the mixture into a wheelbarrow.\\n\\n\\u201cThis was all grass,\\u201d Hilliard said of the sandy mess beneath her feet. \\u201cThey\\u2019re going to have to make 500 trips of this.\\u201d\\n\\nHilliard, who moved to Florida six months ago and lives further inland, said she was happy to pitch in and help clean up her friend\\u2019s home a block from the shore in Bradenton Beach\\n\\nFurniture and household appliances sat outside alongside debris from interior drywall that was removed after Helene sent several feet of storm surge into the house. Inside, walls were gutted up to 4 feet (1.2 meters), exposing the beams underneath.\\n\\n\\u201cYou roll with the punches,\\u201d she said. \\u201cCommunity is the best part, though. Everybody helping each other.\\u201d\\n\\nMilton killed at least 10 people after it made landfall as a Category 3 storm, tearing across central Florida, flooding barrier islands and spawning deadly tornadoes. Officials say the toll could have been worse if not for the widespread evacuations.\\n\\nOverall, more than a thousand people had been rescued in the wake of the storm as of Saturday, DeSantis said.\\n\\nProperty damage and economic costs in the billions\\n\\nOn Sunday, President Joe Biden will survey the devastation inflicted on Florida\\u2019s Gulf Coast by the hurricane. He said he hopes to connect with DeSantis during the visit.\\n\\nThe trip offers Biden another opportunity to press Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson to call lawmakers back to Washington to approve more funding during their preelection recess. It\\u2019s something Johnson says he won\\u2019t do.\\n\\nBiden is making the case that Congress needs to act now to ensure the Small Business Administration and FEMA have the money they need to get through hurricane season, which stretches through November in the Atlantic.\\n\\nDeSantis welcomed the federal government\\u2019s approval of a disaster declaration announced Saturday and said he had gotten strong support from Biden.\\n\\n\\u201cHe basically said, you know, you guys are doing a great job. We\\u2019re here for you,\\u201d he said when asked about his conversations with Biden. \\u201cWe sent a big request and we got approved for what we wanted.\\u201d\\n\\nMoody\\u2019s Analytics on Saturday estimated economic costs from the storm will range from $50 billion to $85 billion, including upwards of $70 billion in property damage and an economic output loss of up to $15 billion.\\n\\nSafety threats remain, including rising rivers\\n\\nAs the recovery continues, DeSantis has warned people to be cautious, citing ongoing safety threats including downed power lines and standing water. Some 1.3 million Floridians were still without power by Saturday afternoon, according to poweroutage.us.\\n\\nNational Weather Service Meteorologist Paul Close said rivers will \\u201ckeep rising\\u201d for the next four or five days resulting in river flooding, mostly around Tampa Bay and northward. Those areas were hit by the most rain, which comes on top of a wet summer that included several earlier hurricanes.\\n\\n\\u201cYou can\\u2019t do much but wait,\\u201d Close said of the rivers cresting. \\u201cAt least there is no rain in the forecast, no substantial rain.

Policy initiatives could have a significant impact on the economy, especially on issues concerning inflation, the housing market, employment, and international trade.\\n\\nThe $1.3 trillion asset manager PGIM surveyed 400 institutional investors collectively overseeing $9 trillion in assets under management about the election. Most investors surveyed agreed that elections influenced how they allocated funds in their portfolios.\\n\\nOverall, 46% of the investors surveyed said that a Republican sweep across the White House and Congress would be the optimal outcome for the market. 29% of investors preferred split control of the White House and Congress. Investors can benefit from both parties: Republicans would likely pass investor-friendly tax and energy policy, while Democrats would pass more favorable US-China and trade policy.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nHere's what Wall Street is worried about this election cycle and how top money managers are preparing their portfolios for November.\\n\\nWall Street's 3 biggest election concerns\\n\\nThere was one clear standout issue: the national debt. 35% of institutional managers flagged the US national debt as the most important policy change they wanted to see.\\n\\nRelated stories\\n\\nKara Murphy, chief investment officer at Kestra Investment Management, says the deficit will continue to balloon from its current level of $35 trillion as higher Medicare, Social Security, and interest expenses stack up.\\n\\nHowever, neither candidate has put forward a concrete plan to address this issue.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\\"The candidates' relative silence on the deficit shows that it's an American problem \\u2013 not just a party problem \\u2013 and one so big and intractable that the next president isn't likely to be able to make much of a near-term impact,\\\" Murphy wrote in a note.\\n\\nSeventeen percent of investors responded that fueling economic growth was their biggest concern. There are both domestic and international challenges to the health of the economy, with institutional managers flagging issues such as inflation, US-China relations, and tariffs.\\n\\nIt's likely that the next administration will implement new tariffs, regardless of which party takes the White House, according to PGIM.\\n\\nWhile Trump is well-known for his love of tariffs, Harris isn't exactly anti-tariff either. Murphy points out the Biden-Harris administration has kept many of the tariffs that Trump passed during his presidency, and even enacted additional tariffs.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nIncreased trade tensions could have negative implications for both US and international markets in China, Latin America, and Southeast Asia. Tariffs often have inflationary effects by slowing down trade and raising prices for consumers. The results of the presidential election will clarify how many new tariffs to expect.\\n\\nThe third biggest concern was immigration reform, with 15% of investors placing it as their most important policy concern. Investment advisor Research Affiliates sees an urgent need for immigration reform as the US population growth rate continues to decline, harming the labor market. According to Research Affiliates, policies such as removing the cap on green cards for immigrants with higher education degrees in STEM fields could solve this issue.\\n\\nPreparing your portfolio\\n\\nThe tight race makes it unlikely for a single party to hold a sweeping majority in the House and Senate and pass drastic policy changes. However, the election winner still has implications for portfolios.\\n\\nOne survey respondent, a portfolio manager for a US-based pension fund, said elections have \\\"been a big factor\\\" when it comes to allocating money. A Republican president is likely to benefit the oil and gas industries, while a Democrat win will boost healthcare, the portfolio manager said.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAn investment director for another pension fund shared the following investment outlook regarding the ongoing decline in globalization and trade relations: \\\"Given reshoring, friend-shoring, [and] less reliance on the likes of China and other trading partners from past decades, we've felt even more confident in some of our exposures, particularly within the US. Basic industry, materials, very middle-market and lower focused, but dedicated US exposure such that if we really continue along this deglobalization path, and if there are further and future rifts, these are the areas that are going to benefit the most.\\\"\\n\\nAs international supply chains experience disruption and technological competition with other countries increases, investors should put money into the companies and sectors benefiting from deglobalization while also adding safe-haven assets to their portfolios. The trend of reshoring will lead to increased domestic construction and jobs.\\n\\nPGIM recommends gold, Treasurys, and the US dollar as examples of stable, low-risk assets.\"\n",

      "            \"text\": \"It\\u2019s a trend that has surprised many: Why, despite being squeezed by high prices, have Americans kept spending at retail stores and restaurants at a robust pace?\\n\\nOne key reason is a relatively simple one: Wealthier consumers, boosted by strong gains in income, home equity and stock market wealth, have increasingly driven the spending.\\n\\nThat trend, documented by Federal Reserve research, represents something of a shift from the pre-pandemic period. And it suggests that consumer spending, the primary driver of the U.S. economy, could help sustain healthy growth this year and next.\\n\\nLower-income consumers, by contrast, have been disproportionately squeezed by higher-priced rent, groceries and other necessities, leaving them less able to spend on discretionary items, like electronics, entertainment and restaurant meals, than they were before the pandemic. Though their spending is starting to rebound as inflation-adjusted incomes rise, it could be years before their finances fully recover.\\n\\nThe disparities help explain the gap between gloomy consumer sentiment and widespread evidence of a healthy U.S. economy \\u2014 a major dynamic in the presidential race that is now in its final weeks. Only a portion of the American population is fueling most of the growth that is evident in government economic data.\\n\\nThe trends also help illustrate how the economy has managed to keep expanding at a solid pace even though the Federal Reserve, until last month, kept its key interest rate at its highest level in more than two decades. Despite the much higher borrowing costs for mortgages, auto loans and credit cards that resulted from the Fed\\u2019s rate hikes, inflation-adjusted consumer spending rose 3% in 2022 and 2.5% in 2023. And it increased at a 2.8% annual rate in the April-June quarter, the government said last month.\\n\\nOn Thursday, the Commerce Department reported that retail sales in the United States rose 0.4% from August to September, a solid gain that suggested that shoppers are confident enough in the economy to continue spending freely. Restaurant sales jumped 1%, a particularly encouraging sign because it meant that many people felt they could spend on meals outside the home. The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta now estimates that the economy grew at a strong 3.4% in the July-September quarter.\\n\\nHigher-income households have been fortified by huge gains in housing and stock market wealth since the pandemic. Home values have marched steadily up, fueled by high demand and an unusually low supply of houses. And the stock market has been consistently hitting new highs, with the S&P 500 index up a sizzling 22.5% for the year. Roughly 80% of stock market value is owned by the richest 10% of U.S. households.\\n\\n\\u201cIt speaks to the ongoing strength of those Americans, which is still carrying overall spending,\\u201d said Michael Pearce, deputy chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics.\\n\\nHousing and stock values have soared in particular for the wealthiest one-tenth of Americans over the past four years. The value of their home equity has leapt 70% from the first quarter of 2020 through the second quarter of this year, according to Fed data \\u2014 to $17.6 trillion. Their stock and mutual fund wealth has jumped 86%, to just under $37 trillion. Though inflation has eroded some of those gains, they are still quite substantial.\\n\\nSuch sharp growth in wealth has reduced the need for affluent Americans to save from their paychecks while still ramping up their spending. A report last week by Fed economists found that before the pandemic, retail spending had been rising for all income groups at roughly the same pace. But about three years ago, the trend shifted: Upper- and middle-income consumers started spending at a much faster pace than lower-earners.\\n\\nBy August 2024, inflation-adjusted spending on retail goods was nearly 17% higher than it was in January 2018 for upper-income households, defined as those earning more than $100,000. For middle-income households \\u2014 earning $60,000 to $100,000 \\u2014 their spending rose 13.3% during the same period, the Fed study found. And for those earning less than $60,000, spending has risen just 7.9% since 2018. It actually fell from mid-2021 through mid-2023.\\n\\n\\u201cMiddle- and high-income households have been fueling the strong demand for retail goods,\\u201d Fed economist Sinem Hacioglu Hoke and two colleagues wrote.\\n\\nAmong those who have felt pressure to spend cautiously is Helaine Rapkin, a 69-year-old teacher who was shopping last week at a Kohl\\u2019s in Ramsey, New Jersey, looking for discounts on athletic wear and gifts for her nephew, niece and daughter. Rapkin said she\\u2019s wrestling with higher costs on a range of items and isn\\u2019t feeling the benefits of a dramatically reduced inflation rate.\\n\\n\\u201cI am not feeling good at all,\\u201d she said. \\u201cI can\\u2019t believe how expensive things have gotten\\u2026Clothes or food.\\u201d\\n\\nPearce, in his own research, has found that since the pandemic, lower-income Americans have had to cut their spending on discretionary items. Inflation sharply increased the portion of their income that they had to spend on housing and food, leaving little for other purchases.\\n\\nAs a result, for the lowest-income one-fifth of Americans \\u2014 those earning less than $28,000 \\u2014 the share of their spending on discretionary items fell 2.5 percentage points by the second quarter of this year compared with 2019. It also declined for the second-lowest one-fifth of households and for the middle fifth. But for the wealthiest one-fifth, the share of their spending on discretionary purchases actually increased.\\n\\n\\u201cThis has clearly been a very large shock to households, particularly those at the lower end,\\u201d Pearce said. \\u201cWhat surprised me is how little has been clawed back.\\u201d\\n\\nOne sign of the struggles that lower-income consumers have faced is that the proportion of borrowers who are behind on credit cards or auto loans has risen in the past two years to the highest levels in about a decade.\\n\\nKaren Dynan, an economist at Harvard and a nonresident fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, suggested, though, that such trends aren\\u2019t likely to derail the overall economy.\\n\\n\\u201cThere are increasing cracks in consumers\\u2019 spending,\\u201d she said. \\u201cBut it\\u2019s not yet a broader economic story.\\u201d\\n\\nDynan and Pearce say they\\u2019re optimistic that consumers overall \\u2014 including lower-income ones \\u2014 will keep spending in the coming months as inflation-adjusted incomes keep rising, restoring more of Americans\\u2019 purchasing power.\\n\\n\\u201cWe\\u2019re probably past the worst, the most intense pressures on spending from both the inflation shock and from rising interest rates,\\u201d Pearce said. \\u201cNow, I think the outlook is pretty strong.\\u201d\"\n",

Investment-bank revenue surged 30% on average at Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Bank of America, Citigroup, and Morgan Stanley, the Wells Fargo analyst Mike Mayo said.\\n\\n\\\"We continue to believe we are in the early stages of a multiyear capital-markets recovery,\\\" Morgan Stanley's CFO, Sharon Yeshaya, said during an earnings call. Morgan Stanley's investment-bank revenue surged 56% year over year to $1.46 billion, beating Wall Street expectations.\\n\\nSeveral tailwinds are at play, including tempering inflation and pent-up demand. Debt underwriting has surged as companies rush to take advantage of interest-rate cuts, S&P Global's Nathan Stovall told Business Insider. After years of recession fears, there's more optimism the Federal Reserve can deliver a soft landing, he said.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\\"You're seeing corporates get more comfortable with the world they're operating in, and they're willing to take more risks, and this leads to more M&A activity, more equity raising, things like that,\\\" Stovall, his company's director of financial-institutions research, said.\\n\\nAn incoming flurry of dealmaking could reflect a broader economic recovery, as lower borrowing costs make it easier for companies to fund acquisitions. This past quarter saw several megamergers, such as the candy giant Mars buying the maker of Pringles for nearly $36 billion. Citi advised Mars and provided $29 billion in debt financing with JPMorgan. Paramount agreed to merge with David Ellison's Skydance Media. Bank of America is one of Skydance's advisors on the $8 billion deal.\\n\\nRelated stories\\n\\nWall Street CEOs, however, are cautious about their enormous wins. JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon said on an earnings call that the favorable interest-rate conditions \\\"may not prevail or be the ongoing conditions late next year\\\" and that geopolitical turmoil was \\\"treacherous and getting worse.\\\" Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon said that while the bank had a healthy backlog, activity in mergers and acquisitions and equity was still well below 10-year averages.\\n\\nRisks to this comeback loom large, Mayo wrote in a research note.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\\"There's little question to us that activity and revenues reflect a degree of bull market banking,\\\" he wrote. \\\"This could end based on potential results and reactions to the upcoming November elections, a stock market decline, and/or unexpected changes in rates (esp. higher).\\\"\\n\\nCole Smead, a portfolio manager, described the results as a \\\"head fake.\\\" Smead is watching the US's ballooning deficit, concerned it could push up bond yields and the cost of borrowing, which would discourage dealmaking.\\n\\n\\\"This can go on for maybe a quarter or two more, but it is likely going to fall apart long before it ever gets back to anywhere near the numbers of 2021,\\\" the CEO of Smead Capital Management, which owns shares of Bank of America and JPMorgan, said. \\\"Ultimately, this equity market, with many risks out there, is complacent and doesn't care. The problem is when the chickens come home to roost, this activity will go back to low levels again.\\\"\\n\\nThe potential 'X-factor'\\n\\nWhile the risks are real, this quarter's upswing isn't necessarily a blip. For the five banks, Mayo estimated that capital-markets revenue would grow 8% in 2025 to $31.7 billion and another 7% to $34 billion in 2026.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThere's also what Mayo calls \\\"the X-factor\\\": the $1 trillion-plus of dry powder held by private-equity firms.\\n\\nJon Gray, the president and chief operating officer of the private-equity giant Blackstone, said that, anecdotally, the number of confidentiality agreements more than doubled in September compared with a year ago.\\n\\n\\\"Now that doesn't necessarily mean it's going to turn into that volume of deals. But it clearly shows you there is more enthusiasm,\\\" Gray said during the firm's earnings call Thursday. \\\"And we know in the private-equity world, there's a lot of companies that need to be sold, similar story in real estate.\\\"\\n\\nDavid Stowell, a finance professor, told BI that while the upcoming US election and overseas conflict posed economic risks, the sponsors couldn't sit on the sidelines indefinitely.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\\"They know that they always have to risk-adjust their investments,\\\" said Stowell, an investment banker for two decades before joining the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University. \\\"They pretty much have to spend the money, or their kind of business goes away.\\\"\\n\\nStovall acknowledged that one quarter doesn't make a trend but said that economic data, such as job-creation numbers, pointed to a soft landing. This bodes well for dealmaking for the rest of the year and 2025.\\n\\n\\\"I'm cautiously optimistic,\\\" he said. \\\"It is wise to not jump up and down and say things are going to go straight up from here, but I do think it's more encouraging than it's been for a while.\\\"\\n\\nFor now, some Wall Streeters can already count on larger bonuses, a compensation consultant, Alan Johnson, said. With debt and equity capital markets thriving, underwriters are set to get the biggest gains. For debt and equity underwriters, he estimated bonus increases of 25% to 35% and 20% to 30%, respectively. M&A bankers will likely have to wait longer for a significant boost and should expect maybe a 5% or 10% uptick this season.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\\"Traditionally, the sexiest area would be M&A \\u2014 the pipeline looks really good, but most of the closing fees would be for 2025,\\\" Johnson, the founder of Johnson Associates, said. \\\"The headlines around M&A are really going to be next year's story.\\\"\"\n",

The central bank had hiked that rate from nearly zero to as high as 5.25% between March 2022 and July 2023 in response to soaring inflation.\\n\\nThe Fed is widely expected to keep lowering rates to stimulate economic growth and stave off a recession \\u2014 while being careful not to rekindle inflation or overheat the job market.\\n\\nBank of America CFO Alastair Borthwick said on an earnings call this week that the bank actually grew its net interest income (NII) \\u2014 revenue from interest-bearing assets minus expenses tied to interest-bearing liabilities \\u2014 in the third quarter compared to the second quarter.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\\"With NII up 2% this quarter, and even with the changing rate trajectory, we remain focused on growing NII on a quarterly basis from here,\\\" he said on the call.\\n\\nBank of America also reported higher fee income, as did Citigroup. CEO Jane Fraser told analysts this week that fee-based revenues at her bank rose by double digits last quarter despite rates declining, \\\"reflecting the growing diversity of our earnings mix.\\\"\\n\\nLower payment rates fueled interest-earning balances last quarter, and the bank grew its retail mortgage portfolio and overall loan book, Fraser said.\\n\\nConsumer revival\\n\\nFalling rates promise to reduce interest payments on mortgages, car loans, credit cards, and other debts. But that could leave consumers with more disposable income, which could benefit banks.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nCitigroup CFO Mark Mason said on the bank's earnings call that inflation cooling and rates dropping helps consumers and the overall economy, which can reduce loan delinquencies and net credit losses for banks as more people can repay their debts. He said the lender is already seeing more stability with delinquencies improving.\\n\\nWells Fargo CEO Charles Scharf said on his bank's earnings call that waning inflation and sliding rates should be especially helpful to lower-income people. However, he reported weaker demand for commercial loans because of economic uncertainty and customers holding off on borrowing until rates fall.\\n\\nRelated stories\\n\\nWells Fargo has reduced rates on some deposits and raised them on others, striking a balance between protecting its profits and losing customers.\\n\\nMorgan Stanley CFO Sharon Yeshaya told analysts this week that her bank's net interest income would likely decrease year-over-year this quarter. Similar to Citi's Fraser, she highlighted loan growth last quarter, saying \\\"this is just the beginning.\\\" She also reported a steady increase in mortgages, and forecasted declining rates would fuel a jump in refinancing activity.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nOn JPMorgan's latest earnings call, CFO Jeremy Barnum reported a \\\"pick up in mortgage applications and a tiny bit of pick up in refi,\\\" as well as \\\"some hints of more activity\\\" in the banking giant's multifamily lending business.\\n\\nBarnum said the lender was yet to see a material acceleration in loan growth or a surge in investment banking deals. But he said the Fed's jumbo rate cut might have sparked more activity in debt capital markets recently.\\n\\nStock surge\\n\\nGoldman Sachs was the exception to the rule this quarter, with little discussion from executives on its earnings call about how falling interest rates are affecting the bank.\\n\\nCEO David Solomon said the Fed's first rate cut has raised hopes of avoiding a US recession, which could translate into more economic activity. He added that Goldman's clients were \\\"highly focused on the trajectory of rates\\\" around the world, among other issues.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nBank stocks have fared well since the Fed cut, with Citi and BoA both up just over 8% in the past month, Goldman rising 9%, Wells Fargo jumping 17% and Morgan Stanley soaring almost 20%.\\n\\nA previous version of this story misspelled Bank of America CFO Alastair Borthwick's first name. It also incorrectly attributed comments he made at Bank of America's Financials CEO Conference in September to the company's third-quarter earnings call.\"\n",

Dominick Reuter/Business Insider\\n\\nNow the location, which reopened on Thursday, gets to be the first in a wave of high-tech stores that aim to tap into a digital shopping experience.\\n\\nNotably, this location eschews checkout lanes. Shoppers ring up their orders on an app and roll their carts through an AI-powered gateway to confirm their purchases.\\n\\nInstead of conveyer belts and cash registers, the front of the store features patio furniture and a Mercedes-Benz SUV tagged with QR codes that shoppers can scan to purchase online for delivery.\\n\\nThe layout of the Grapevine Sam's Club looks different than other locations because it lacks checkout lanes. Dominick Reuter/Business Insider\\n\\nCEO Chris Nicholas told Business Insider this location was a test bed for a lower-friction approach to the club-store format \\u2014 a strategy to be reflected in new stores and remodels.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\\"This, here, represents what the future looks like for Sam's Club,\\\" he said. \\\"Our plan is that you will see a lot of the facets of what's in this club in not just new clubs but over time across our fleet.\\\"\\n\\nBefore becoming Sam's Club's CEO, Nicholas was the chief operating officer for Walmart US. He was instrumental in that division's store-modernization strategy unveiled last year.\\n\\nRelated stories\\n\\nPieces of the Sam's Club strategy have been rolling out in recent years, including the scan-and-go app functionality, the computer-vision cart checks, and floor scrubbers that monitor inventory and update in-stock information. There are also pizza-preparing robots.\\n\\nThose technologies come together in Grapevine. The intended result is the convenience increasingly common in smaller-format retail settings combined with the low-markup pricing that typically can be found only when buying in bulk.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nSeveral shoppers told Business Insider that they had been using the scan-and-go tech for a while at other locations and that it performed smoothly for the grand opening. Any hiccups they noticed were attributed to the unusually high volume of customers shopping on Thursday morning for the store's opening.\\n\\nSam's Club said the individual pieces of technology had been working well. Now it's time to see how they all play together.\\n\\nIf you are a Sam's Club worker who wants to share your perspective, please contact Dominick via email or text/call/Signal at 646-768-4750.

The greenback weakened as markets prepared for steep rate cuts, but that move has reversed in recent weeks as strong economic data makes more aggressive policy easing less likely.\\n\\n\\\"One of the things that could cause the rally to kind of slow down is if the dollar were to strengthen again. And that's starting to happen. So that's probably the one thing we're watching for now that could kind of throw a wrench in this pace of new records every day,\\\" Wilson said in a Tuesday interview with Bloomberg Radio.\\n\\nWilson says US dollar liquidity, or dollar supply growth, has started rising rapidly in the last month or so after bottoming out almost two years ago, mostly due to expanded balance sheets in China and Japan and a weaker dollar.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nA stronger dollar would thus interrupt the rally, he says.\\n\\nThe dollar has gained about 2% against a basket of rival currencies since the start of the month. That renewed strength comes as investors price in a slower easing cycle from the Federal Reserve amid a hot economy and still-elevated inflation.\\n\\nWilson's call comes two years into the market's bull rally, with major indexes continuing to hit fresh all-time highs. The S&P 500 index has clocked three records in the last week, and is up over 23% since the start of the year.\\n\\nWilson attributes the market's gains to easing from most major central banks, including those in the US and China, and says the rally is broadening out.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\\"It's a policy driven rally, and it's very robust. And it's even broadening out now,\\\" Wilson said, adding, \\\"That will continue until basically either you get a real shock on the economic front, or fundamentally speaking, you get a restriction on a liquidity front.\\\"\\n\\nWilson said almost all of the returns in the last year have been a result of multiple expansion, rather than higher earnings revisions. He said multiples are now 22 times the index level, which has happened only a few times in recent history.\\n\\nHe added that even though the rally is fiscally driven, it isn't threatened by the upcoming results from the presidential or congressional elections.\\n\\n\\\"Neither party has really shown any willingness or ability to slow the freight train on fiscal spend. I think the bigger concern is how do they fund it,\\\" he said.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nWilson says a bigger risk will emerge when the bond market starts feeling pressure from the size of fiscal deficits, but it's tough to say when that might happen.\\n\\n\\\"Maybe they can pull it off. Maybe we can inflate our way out and we can get better growth next year,\\\" Wilson said. \\\"That's the game that we're playing, and right now that's a bull market.\\\"\"\n",

It surveyed 886 registered voters nationwide.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Baier asked Harris about the US border with Mexico: \\\"How many illegal immigrants would you estimate your administration has released into the country over the last 3 \\u00bd years?\\\" he asked.\\n\\nHarris didn't answer the question directly.

However, just one-quarter or less of their processes were digitized or automated in the past 12 months.\\n\\nAs a CFO, you have to determine where you are going to allocate the spending because it could be significant, Ferraro said.\\n\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s more than just saying, \\u2018Here\\u2019s the money, go do it,\\u201d she said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a culture shift and a learning journey.\\u201d\\n\\nAt Siemens, Ferraro said she has embarked on a digital and finance initiative, which involves looking at the areas where all the businesses and functions in the organization intersect. Then, she says, the goal is to get everyone aligned on a North Star when it comes to AI and automation\\u2014a task that will also involve upskilling and addressing areas where some are still working with legacy tools.\\n\\nEmily Reuter, CFO of the grocery-delivery business Instacart, said that at the end of the day, Instacart is a technology company. \\u201cSo if we\\u2019re going to invest anywhere, that\\u2019s where it\\u2019s going to be,\\u201d Reuter said. AI is incorporated into Instacart\\u2019s product and set to meet future e-commerce trends, she said.\\n\\nRegarding the finance function, generative AI can unlock areas of growth and efficiency, she said. \\u201cWe\\u2019re going to take a lower risk approach and really try to understand what\\u2019s going on out there, and where we feel comfortable,\\u201d Reuter said.\\n\\nAt the cosmetics and skincare company e.l.f.

Before that, he spent seven years at Teladoc Health where he held the roles of CFO and chief operating officer. Hirschhorn was also previously president and COO of Talkspace.\\n\\nWilliam L. Phelan was named CFO and chief accounting officer at Luna Innovations Incorporated (Nasdaq: LUNA), a fiber optic-based technology provider, effective immediately. Phelan succeeds John Roiko, who joined Luna out of retirement in May. Roiko will shift to a consulting role. Phelan brings more than 25 years of experience. He has been a full-time advisor to the company since May. Before joining Luna, Phelan served as chief accounting officer at MiMedx Group, Inc.\\n\\nBig deal\\n\\nA CFO\\u2019s competence is the most important factor when considering investing in a company, second only to market expansion, and ranking above the competency of the CEO. That\\u2019s one of the key findings of the report, \\u201cFinance 2035: Return to Investment,\\u201d newly released by KKR-backed software company OneStream.\\n\\nThe data is based on a survey of 2,000 global CFOs, CEOs, line of business leaders, and investors. And 88% percent of investors and 65% of business leaders agree the CFO will become more important to business success over the next 10 years.\\n\\nWith persistent economic uncertainties and an evolving regulatory environment, finance chiefs already feel pressure, according to Tom Shea, CEO of OneStream. And a lot of chief executives rely on CFOs as their strategic partners. The research found that 67% of CEOs surveyed believe an organization\\u2019s success or failure rests on the shoulders of the CFO.\\n\\nCompanies want to understand the trends that are driving their business in real time, Shea said during a media event OneStream hosted on Monday in New York City.

Some of the proposals in the initiative are built on previously announced policies.\\n\\nOver the past few weeks, Harris has released a slate of proposals aimed at making healthcare more affordable and accessible for Americans, and her latest announcement builds on that effort. According to her campaign, Harris plans to recruit 10,000 healthcare professionals to work in rural and tribal areas. To incentivize those workers, the initiative would expand scholarships, student-loan repayment programs, and the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program \\u2014 which forgives student loans for government and nonprofit workers after 10 years of qualifying payments \\u2014 to make it easier for the healthcare workers to pay off their educations.\\n\\nThe campaign is also proposing new measures to help keep local pharmacies and rural hospitals afloat, along with maintaining and strengthening access to telehealth.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nRural healthcare shortages are a widespread problem across the country. According to data from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, over 25 million Americans live in rural regions that have a shortage of primary care providers, generally defined by HHS as fewer than one doctor per 3,500 residents. Research from the Journal of General Internal Medicine has found that 20% of Americans live in rural areas \\u2014 but just 10% of doctors practice in those same areas.\\n\\nTo address gaps in healthcare coverage, Harris last week proposed a Medicare benefit to cover in-home care needs for older adults to appeal to the \\\"sandwich generation,\\\" or the adults who are raising young kids while also caring for aging parents. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 37.1 million Americans provide unpaid eldercare.\\n\\nRelated stories\\n\\n\\\"There are so many people in our country who are right in the middle,\\\" Harris said during an interview on The View. \\\"They're taking care of their kids, and they're taking care of their aging parents, and it's just almost impossible to do it all, especially if they work.\\\"\\n\\nMatthew Hildreth, the Harris campaign's director of rural engagement, told Business Insider in a statement that \\\"the Harris-Walz campaign is making a real commitment to rural communities.\\\"\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\\"They both understand that rural voters are the foundation of our country, and they want rural voters to know that they have a home in their campaign - that is fundamentally about patriotism, freedom and opportunity,\\\" Hildreth said.\\n\\nFormer President Donald Trump had a stronghold over rural voters in the 2020 election, and while he's fighting to maintain that lead this time around \\u2014 his campaign launched a \\\"Rural Americans for Trump\\\" coalition in August \\u2014 Harris and her VP pick Tim Walz are hoping to latch onto the rural voters who are not sold on Trump. The proposals come after the Trump administration launched their own effort in 2020 to combat the issues facing rural healthcare, with communities pitching the Trump administration on potential solutions.\\n\\nAnna Kelly, the Republican National Committee spokesperson, told Business Insider in a statement that Harris is \\\"lying about plans to make healthcare and overall costs more affordable for rural communities.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"President Trump will fight to get Americans the best drug prices in the world that are produced at the highest standard by manufacturing them here in the USA,\\\" Kelly said.\"\n",

However, she couldn't schedule appointments for follow-up care, which doctors consider necessary for proper recovery. For several months after her meniscus surgery, Case kept calling the center for an appointment with no success while her knee deteriorated.\\n\\nNow Case takes time off from work and spends up to $125 round trip on gas while traveling to Portland for arthritis care. Case said that symptoms like stiffness, swelling, and discomfort \\u2014 which resulted from a lack of postsurgical medical support \\u2014 could interfere with her sleep, gait, and ability to enjoy her hobbies like hiking and gardening.\\n\\n\\\"Until you've experienced not being able to see a doctor, you don't really realize how frustrating it is,\\\" Case, who is 53, told Business Insider. Eventually, she will need surgery for a full knee replacement.\\n\\nCase said that she remains concerned that the overall lack of medical care in her community, as she's observed doctors retiring or leaving her area.\\n\\nSome of her family members and friends also struggle to find physicians close to home, Case said, so they have to drive long distances or wait for appointments.\\n\\nA March report from the Association of American Medical Colleges projected that the US would face a physician shortage of up to 86,000 specialists and primary-care doctors by 2036.\\n\\nMichael Dill, the organization's director of workforce studies, said this estimate was conservative.\\n\\n\\\"The country needs hundreds of thousands of doctors to provide an equal amount of care to everyone, including minorities, those without medical insurance, and people living in rural areas,\\\" he told BI.\\n\\nAn aging population, physician retirement, and the administrative challenges of running a practice contribute to the shortage and disproportionally affect vulnerable populations such as older people, those lacking transportation options, and people with disabilities, public-health advocates told BI.\\n\\nTwo solutions could be increasing medical-training programs in rural communities and passing legislation to retain and bolster the physician workforce.\\n\\nAn aging population and provider burnout are contributing to a worsening doctor shortage\\n\\nThe effects of a doctor shortage are already here, Dr. Bruce Scott, the president of the American Medical Association, said.\\n\\nScott practices in Louisville, Kentucky, and said that in addition to patients in rural areas driving hours to appointments, they're waiting months to see a doctor.\\n\\nVarious factors, including an aging population, play a part in the situation, Dill said.\\n\\nIn 2020, 55.8 million Americans, or 16.8% of the population, were 65 or older, and by 2030, all baby boomers will have reached age 65, according to a US Census report. As people age, they require more physician services, such as cardiologic or neurological care, and at the same time, doctors are aging and retiring, adding to the shortage, Dill said.\\n\\nPhysician burnout further exacerbates the problem, Scott said. In one survey that was part of AMA Organizational Biopsy report, of over 12,400 doctors, 48% of respondents said they were burned out. In another survey from the same report, one in three respondents said they planned to retire or reduce hours within two years.\\n\\nOne AMA survey found some doctors were leaving their practices because they were being paid less to handle more administrative burdens, such as spending 12 hours a week filling out prior-authorization requests. \\\"Medicare is paying us nearly 30% less in 2024 than it did in 2001, when adjusted for inflation,\\\" Scott said, citing further data compiled by the AMA.\\n\\nStrategies to alleviate the shortage\\n\\nTo help alleviate the physician shortage in rural areas, medical students need to receive training there, said Molly Fox, the vice president of institutional advancement at Kansas Health Science University.\\n\\n\\\"We engage students with the rural community because we know that people tend to practice where they feel connected,\\\" Fox said.\\n\\nAt KHSU's Kansas College of Osteopathic Medicine, for example, third- and fourth-year students can complete clinical rotations at St. Catherine Hospital in Garden City, four hours from Wichita, where the university is.\\n\\nChase Hearn, a third-year student, said he'd seen doctors at the hospital who have worked 26-hour shifts to meet patient needs.\\n\\n\\\"I've also heard patients say they can't take a day off work to travel 200 miles to see their OB-GYN,\\\" Hearn said. He added that his training had strengthened his resolve to practice in a rural community but that he anticipated challenges, like burnout and working with patients who lack consistent access to care.\\n\\nRural residency programs are also needed to address the shortage, Dill said. Only 2% of residency training occurs in rural areas, the US Government Accountability Office says.\\n\\nA residency program through Oregon Health & Sciences University aims to alleviate the doctor shortage in three central-Oregon counties, including Crook County, where Case lives. The program is training physicians in primary care, family birthing, emergency medicine, behavioral health, and hospital medicine.\\n\\nAccording to the Rural Medical Training Collaborative, 133 rural residencies in family medicine and 69 rural-track programs are recruiting for 2025 enrollment, along with 30 internal-medicine residencies and 16 psychiatry residencies.\\n\\nSeveral pieces of legislation have also been introduced to Congress to address the doctor shortage. Scott said bills to adjust Medicare payments for doctors \\u2014 no matter where they practice \\u2014 to the annual rate of inflation and rules to reduce the need for prior authorization could help ease administrative burdens.\\n\\nSome legislation, if passed, would specifically influence rural areas.\\n\\nFor example, HR 7855, the Association of American Medical Colleges-endorsed Rural Residency Planning and Development Act of 2024, would codify the Rural Residency Planning and Development Program, which funds the startup costs of residency training in rural areas, Dill said. From 2019 to 2024, the program has enabled the launch of 46 accredited rural residency programs across 38 states and Puerto Rico.\\n\\nHollie Davis Frick, an immigration lawyer for Wintersteen Patel Law Group, said congressional action could easily incentivize doctors born abroad and who receive advanced medical training in the US to remain here and practice in rural areas.\\n\\n\\\"Many doctors who come here for residencies and fellowships return abroad because of our ineffective immigration policies,\\\" Davis Frick said.\\n\\nIf passed, S 665, the Conrad State 30 and Physician Access Reauthorization Act, would allow state health departments to sponsor additional visa waivers for foreign-born doctors who agree to practice in underserved areas within those states.\\n\\nWhile Case remains skeptical that doctor-training initiatives and legislation will directly affect her community anytime soon, she considers herself fortunate, she said.\\n\\n\\\"I have the ability to drive, afford travel expenses, and pay for out-of-network doctors,\\\" Case said. \\\"Not everybody does.\\\"\"\n",

      "            \"text\": \"With characteristic bravado, Donald Trump has vowed that if voters return him to the White House, \\u201cinflation will vanish completely.\\u201d\\n\\nIt\\u2019s a message tailored for Americans who are still exasperated by the jump in consumer prices that began 3 1/2 years ago.\\n\\nYet most mainstream economists say Trump\\u2019s policy proposals wouldn\\u2019t vanquish inflation. They\\u2019d make it worse. They warn that his plans to impose huge tariffs on imported goods, deport millions of migrant workers and demand a voice in the Federal Reserve\\u2019s interest rate policies would likely send prices surging.\\n\\nSixteen Nobel Prize-winning economists signed a letter in June expressing fear that Trump\\u2019s proposals would \\u201creignite\\u2019\\u2019 inflation, which has plummeted since peaking at 9.1% in 2022 and is nearly back to the Fed\\u2019s 2% target.\\n\\nLast month, the Peterson Institute for International Economics predicted that Trump\\u2019s policies would drive consumer prices sharply higher two years into his second term. Peterson\\u2019s analysis concluded that inflation, which would otherwise register 1.9% in 2026, would instead jump to between 6% and 9.3% if Trump\\u2019s economic proposals were adopted.\\n\\nMany economists aren\\u2019t thrilled with Vice President Kamala Harris\\u2019 economic agenda, either. They dismiss, for example, her proposal to combat price gouging as an ineffective tool against high grocery prices. But they don\\u2019t regard her policies as particularly inflationary.\\n\\nMoody\\u2019s Analytics has estimated that Harris\\u2019 policies would leave the inflation outlook virtually unchanged, even if she enjoyed a Democratic majority in both chambers of Congress. An unfettered Trump, by contrast, would leave prices higher by 1.1 percentage points in 2025 and 0.8 percentage points in 2026.\\n\\nConsumers pay for tariffs\\n\\nTaxes on imports \\u2014 tariffs \\u2014 are Trump\\u2019s go-to economic policy. He argues that tariffs protect American factory jobs from foreign competition and deliver a host of other benefits.\\n\\nWhile in office, Trump started a trade war with China, imposing high tariffs on most Chinese goods. He also raised import taxes on foreign steel and aluminum, washing machines and solar panels. He has grander plans for a second term: Trump wants to impose a 60% tariff on all Chinese goods and a \\u201cuniversal\\u2019\\u2019 tariff of 10% or 20% on everything else that enters the United States.\\n\\nTrump insists that the cost of taxing imported goods is absorbed by the foreign countries. The truth is that U.S. importers pay the tariff \\u2014 and then typically pass along that cost to consumers in the form of higher prices. Americans themselves end up bearing the cost.\\n\\nKimberly Clausing and Mary Lovely of the Peterson Institute have calculated that Trump\\u2019s proposed 60% tax on Chinese imports and his high-end 20% tariff on everything else would, in combination, impose an after-tax loss on a typical American household of $2,600 a year.\\n\\nThe Trump campaign notes that U.S. inflation remained low even as Trump aggressively imposed tariffs as president.\\n\\nBut Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\\u2019s Analytics, said that the magnitude of Trump\\u2019s current tariff proposals has vastly changed the calculations. \\u201cThe Trump tariffs in 2018-19 didn\\u2019t have as large an impact as the tariffs were only just over $300 billion in mostly Chinese imports,\\u2019\\u2019 he said. \\u201cThe former president is now talking about tariffs on over $3 trillion in imported goods.\\u201d\\n\\nAnd the inflationary backdrop was different during Trump\\u2019s first term when the Fed worried that inflation was too low, not too high.\\n\\nTrump Would Reverse an Immigration Surge That Helped Ease Inflation\\n\\nTrump, who has invoked incendiary rhetoric about immigrants, has promised the \\u201clargest deportation operation\\u201d in U.S. history.\\n\\nMany economists the increased immigration over the past couple years helped tame inflation while avoiding a recession.\\n\\nThe surge in foreign-born workers has made it easier for fill vacancies. That helps cool inflation by easing the pressure on employers to sharply raise pay and to pass on their higher labor costs by increasing prices.\\n\\nNet immigration \\u2014 arrivals minus departures \\u2014 reached 3.3 million in 2023, more than triple what the government had expected. Employers needed the new arrivals. As the economy roared back from pandemic lockdowns, companies struggled to hire enough workers to keep up with customer orders.\\n\\nImmigrants filled the gap. Over the past four years, the number of people in the United States who either have a job or are looking for one rose by nearly 8.5 million. Roughly 72% of them were foreign born.\\n\\nWendy Edelberg and Tara Watson of the Brookings Institution found that by raising the supply of workers. the influx of immigrants allowed the United States to generate jobs without overheating the economy.\\n\\nIn the past, economists estimated that America\\u2019s employers could add no more than 100,000 jobs a month without igniting inflation. But when Edelberg and Watson factored in the immigration surge, they found that monthly job growth could reach 160,000 to 200,000 without exerting upward pressure on prices.\\n\\nTrump\\u2019s mass deportations, if carried out, would change everything. The Peterson Institute calculates that the U.S. inflation rate would be 3.5 percentage points higher in 2026 if Trump managed to deport all 8.3 million undocumented immigrant workers thought to be working in the United States.\\n\\nA politicized Fed would make inflation-fighting harder\\n\\nTrump alarmed many economists in August by saying he would seek to have \\u201ca say\\u201d in the Fed\\u2019s interest rate decisions.\\n\\nThe Fed is the government\\u2019s chief inflation-fighter. It attacks high inflation by raising interest rates to restrain borrowing and spending, slow the economy and cool the rate of price increases.\\n\\nEconomic research has found that the Fed and other central banks can properly manage inflation only if they\\u2019re kept independent of political pressure. That\\u2019s because raising rates can cause economic pain \\u2014 perhaps a recession \\u2014 so it\\u2019s anathema to politicians seeking reelection.\\n\\nAs president, Trump frequently hounded Jerome Powell, the Fed chair he had chosen, to lower rates to try to juice the economy. For many economists, Trump\\u2019s public pressure on Powell exceeded even the attempts that Presidents Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon made to push previous Fed chairs to keep rates low \\u2014 moves that were widely blamed for helping spur the chronic inflation of the late 1960s and \\u201970s.\\n\\nThe Peterson Institute report found that upending the Fed\\u2019s independence would increase inflation by 2 percentage points a year.\"\n",

He name-checked the CHIPS Act and the Inflation Reduction Act\\u2014both announced in 2022\\u2014as two major contributors.\\n\\nThe CHIPS Act led to over $230 billion in private-sector spending for the semiconductor manufacturing industry; the Inflation Reduction Act led to $201 billion in construction spending. At the same time, the U.S.\\u2019s GDP\\u2014which grew last year at a much larger rate than expected, 3.3% annualized\\u2014is another major factor.

Rich people have never been such a large group\\u2014but breaking in has never been more of an uphill battle, with some experts saying it now takes $50 or $100 million in assets to join the club.\\n\\nPassion projects for the richest of the rich\\n\\nThe number of wealthy individuals globally are set to rise by another 28% or so over the next four years, Knight Frank predicted in its report, but the rate of expansion will be \\u201cnoticeably slower\\u201d than in the five-year period between 2018 and 2023, mainly owing to the impacts of inflation.\\n\\n\\u201cThis expanding cohort of wealthy individuals looks favorably on real estate,\\u201d Knight Frank went on. \\u201cAlmost a fifth of UHNWIs plan to invest in commercial real estate this year, while more than a fifth are planning to buy residential. Growth over the forecast period provides various opportunities for investors, particularly developers able to deliver property that suits the shifting tastes of the newly minted.\\u201d\\n\\nAlmost all (91%) of UHNWIs gravitate towards passion investments, Capgemini research has found, like luxury real estate, wine, collectibles, and art. \\u201cThe growing appetite for luxury second homes has pushed real-estate advice into the top five of UHNWIs\\u2019 service requirements when deciding to select a wealth management firm,\\u201d Ghanem added.\"\n",

According to Seth Carpenter, the bank's global chief economist, those two factors could put the US on a path to a hard landing.\\n\\nCarpenter highlighted risks in the job market, with most companies having filled open positions after dealing with a shortage of workers during the pandemic. Total job openings in the US clocked in around 8 million in August \\u2014 down 34% from their peak in March 2022, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nShould the economy slow for any reason \\u2014 such as because of the cumulative impact of rate hikes since 2022 \\u2014 employers are more likely than they were a year ago to lay off employees, Carpenter said.\\n\\n\\\"And that's usually what contributes to a recession. A slowdown, then people get laid off, laid off people spend less, the economy slows down more, and it snowballs,\\\" he added. \\\"And so, if we do get a big slowdown for some reason, maybe there's more risk than there was, say, a year ago.\\\"\\n\\nUS companies have announced plans to cut 609,242 jobs from the start of the year through September, up 0.8% from job cuts announced in the same period last year, according to an analysis from Challenger, Gray & Christmas.\\n\\nAnother weakness that could push the US into recession stems from possible tariffs after the presidential election, with Trump vowing to impose 10% tariff on nearly all imported goods, and a 60% tariff on imported Chinese goods.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nExperts have said those measures are inflationary and could raise prices for consumers, potentially leading people to spend less and sparking a slowdown, Carpenter speculated.\\n\\nTariffs could also result in higher prices for goods that producers need in industries like manufacturing. That could lead companies to produce less or invest less in production, another thing that could influence a slowdown.\\n\\nRelated stories\\n\\nIf Trump implements the 10% universal tariff and the 60% tariff on Chinese goods at the same time, that could cause inflation to tick up 0.9 percentage points, per Morgan Stanley's projections. Meanwhile, GDP could fall as much as 1.5 percentage points, the equivalent of third-quarter GDP growth being slashed in half.\\n\\n\\\"So that's another place where I think we could be wrong,\\\" Carpenter said of his recession forecast, though he reiterated that a downturn wasn't his baseline view. \\\"It could be a big hit to the economy, but that's one place where there's just lots of uncertainty, so we have to flag it as a risk to our clients.\\\"\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThe US economic outlook has brightened in recent months, and most forecasters on Wall Street are growing more confident about the prospect of a soft-landing or even a no-landing scenario, a situation where the economy continues to grow in a way that could reignite inflation.\\n\\nAs of September, the economy had a 57% chance of tipping into a downturn within the next 12 months, according to the latest projection from the New York Fed.\\n\\n\\\"We have been pretty constructive all along the whole hiking cycle. In fact, we've been calling for a soft landing. And if anything, where we were wrong with our forecast so far is that things have turned out even better than we dare hoped,\\\" Carpenter added.\"\n",

Data tracking global deaths in conflicts since the year 1400 shows a steep drop throughout the 1990s and into the early 2000s. Across human history, this time of prosperity is a small blip, but the leaders of economies and companies today don\\u2019t know anything different.\\n\\nThat\\u2019s beginning to change, most notably because of the Israel-Hamas and Russia-Ukraine wars.\\n\\n\\u201cGeopolitics is rising up the ranks in terms of areas of risk that directors are concerned about,\\u201d says Dottie Schindlinger, executive director at the Diligent Institute. \\u201cThat said, we also know from our research that directors aren\\u2019t quite sure exactly what to do about it.\\u201d\\n\\nLast year, the Diligent Institute just happened to conclude an annual study the day before the conflict broke out in the Middle East. The survey showed that only 7% of directors polled said geopolitical risks would greatly influence their ability to execute their business objectives in 2024. So far this year, as the survey is finishing up its work, 13% of respondents say geopolitics are a major risk. Today, three out of four directors surveyed rate geopolitical events as either \\u201cmedium\\u201d or \\u201chigh\\u201d risk.\\n\\n\\u201cThere\\u2019s sort of this understanding that we\\u2019re not spending a lot of time on this now, but when and if something happens, it\\u2019s likely to have major disruptions for us,\\u201d says Schindlinger.\\n\\nGeopolitics can weigh on global business\\n\\nBut anecdotally, Schindlinger shares that when board members discuss geopolitics, they tend to focus more on national elections and the impact that potential legislation may have on their businesses.\\n\\nThat\\u2019s a misunderstanding of geopolitics, according to Fordham. Geopolitics are cross-border actions that nations perform to project power, including war, espionage, sanctions, and tariffs. \\u201cGeopolitics is about power,\\u201d she says. \\u201cPower first, money comes after. It\\u2019s the other way around for most people in business.\\u201d\\n\\nThe latest global conflicts highlight the impact that geopolitics can have on global business. Russia\\u2019s invasion of Ukraine led many Western companies, ranging from Exxon Mobil to H&M to Nike, to close their stores and pull their investments from Russia. Several Russian banks were booted from the financial infrastructure known as Swift, a move meant to complicate trade and foreign investment.\\n\\nThose actions were unprecedented and highlight the risks that geopolitics presents, especially to supply chains. The invasion of Ukraine led to big fears about a spike in food prices, which did occur to some extent but wasn\\u2019t as bad as some had feared.\\n\\n\\u201cAs dramatic as that was, the integration and the dependence between Russia and other countries in the world is tiny compared to if something like that were to happen with China and the United States,\\u201d says Fordham.\\n\\nMarkets have also been complacent about risks in the Middle East, even as escalation continues to grow. \\u201cBut one unexpected manifestation of the Middle East risk has been consumer boycotts and the protests in the United States,\\u201d Fordham warns.\\n\\nStarbucks and McDonald\\u2019s are among the U.S.-based multinational companies that have faced protests for their perceived support of Israel in the ongoing military conflict in Gaza. These protests are an example of why boards and C-suite leaders should rethink their standard approach to geopolitics. Typically, Fordham says, a retired general or similar global expert is brought in once a year to provide some strategic advice.\\n\\nUnder pressure on the social front\\n\\nBeyond warfare, boards are also facing pressure from employees, consumers, and their shareholders about whether to engage in social issues. More recently, chief executive officers have taken a quieter stance on news events like the Israel-Hamas war. Most have been backing away from talking about politically fraught topics like diversity and inclusion or climate change. When they do highlight their work on these issues, they are softening the language to avoid getting ensnared in a culture war.\\n\\n\\u201cWhat I observe is a deep sense of uncertainty from the C-suite and boards about what they\\u2019re supposed to do right now in this environment,\\u201d says Fordham.\\n\\nEmployees, especially younger workers, are calling for corporate leaders to talk more about the cultural issues of the day. But at the same time, shareholders and board members are more inclined to put the greater focus on their core business and growth.\\n\\n\\u201cI\\u2019m having conversations with boards right now saying, \\u2018We know there\\u2019s a lot of geopolitical risk. We want to talk about growth,\\u2019\\u201d shares Fordham. \\u201cFair enough. How do you do that without thinking about risk? I don\\u2019t think you can.\\u201d\"\n",

He writes about his experiences and tips for baby boomers interested in doing the same. The discussion has been edited for length and clarity.\\n\\nIn the early 2000s, I had a good run in the real-estate industry. I was doing mortgages and had a real estate and finance radio show with a partner in Los Angeles. I was making good money.\\n\\nHowever, everything fell during the 2008 recession \\u2014 I don't know if I could have prepared for such a downturn.\\n\\nFor many people, if they have a medical problem or financial setback, it takes very little to deplete their savings. It happened to me.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nOver four years, I liquidated my retirement accounts, savings, and investment property, reducing my income from a healthy six figures to a very small amount.\\n\\nLike many older people, I found myself a lot closer to homelessness than I cared to admit.\\n\\nThe ordeal was a real adjustment to my ego because no one likes to think that they're 60 years old and a failure, and that they've lost everything they worked for their entire lives, especially when their peak earning years are behind them.\\n\\nI had to cut costs to survive\\n\\nSince I was never a consistent saver and California's cost of living was rising, I knew retirement would be a struggle.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nI realized I had to start rebuilding myself to survive for the rest of my life.\\n\\nWhile so many things were outside my control \\u2014 the economy and my clients \\u2014 I knew I could control my expenses, where I lived, and my lifestyle.\\n\\nI became a minimalist.\\n\\nIn 2013, after 27 years of marriage, I divorced and went from living in a large four-bedroom house worth $700,000 to renting a room in an Airbnb in Costa Mesa, Orange County, for around $700 a month.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAfter the recovery from the recession, I had no interest in getting back into real estate. Instead, I started a video-marketing consulting company.\\n\\nBut Orange County living was still pricey, so I started taking Social Security as early as I could \\u2014 at age 62 \\u2014 to supplement my income.\\n\\nRelated stories\\n\\nLeaving the US made the most financial sense\\n\\nLeaving the United States was never on my radar, my dream, or my goal.\\n\\nIt all happened accidentally when I was invited to speak in Europe as a video-marketing consultant in 2016. Over three weeks in Europe, I recognized that the cost of living outside the US was far more reasonable.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThat's when the light went on.\\n\\nFrom a financial standpoint, it made sense to move abroad. There was also so much of the world I wanted to experience. I also knew my consulting business was location-independent.\\n\\nThe view from Bour's room in Valencia, Spain, in February 2019. Courtesy of Norman Bour\\n\\nMy girlfriend at the time, now wife, and I left the US in February 2019.\\n\\nBefore we left California, I sold everything I owned through garage sales and also had about $8,000 in savings.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdditionally, I receive $1,700 a month from Social Security and, at the time, was making another $1,000 a month from consulting and writing. My wife received alimony as well, so she was making around $1,100, giving us a total monthly income of about $3,000.\\n\\nHad we continued living in California, it would have felt like living at the poverty level when you added up the costs of rent, insurance, food, a car, gasoline, and all the other expenses. I would have been in a bad financial position.\\n\\nWe're living cheaply abroad in many countries\\n\\nOver the years, my wife and I have visited and lived together in about 43 countries in South America, Europe, and Asia, including Albania, Bulgaria, Croatia, Ecuador, Germany, Greece, Italy, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Spain.\\n\\nSeveral factors drive us when choosing where to live, with the weather being the most important. After living in Southern California for 40 years, we are not cold-weather people.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAnother factor is the cost of living. We try to avoid living in expensive places like Copenhagen or France; otherwise, we would be in the same financial situation as in the US.\\n\\nBour's wife rented a scooter and rode along the French Riviera in Nice, France. Courtesy of Norman Bour\\n\\nWe arrived in Asia in November 2023 after taking a flight from Australia. We've been to Vietnam, Thailand, and Bali and now live in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.\\n\\nIt's a pleasant place to be. We walk a lot, and the temperature is comfortable. We live in a nice, large one-bedroom apartment with a big bathroom, a beautiful balcony, and a lovely view, all for $700 a month.\\n\\nThe Batu Cave in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Courtesy of Norman Bour\\n\\nWe came to Malaysia for several reasons. One big reason is that we hadn't been here much before, and also because it is a very affordable country for medical care.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nMy wife is going to need cataract surgery, which could cost $4,000 to $6,000 in the US. She can have it done in Malaysia for probably less than $2,000.\\n\\nWhile living abroad, we self-insure. We have Medicare but dropped Part B \\u2014 which covers doctors and prescriptions \\u2014 since we were paying $170 a month for it and had virtually no chance of using it without a home in the US.\\n\\nIt was the right decision to move abroad as a boomer\\n\\nI miss certain aspects of the US, like my friends, and familiar comforts, such as visiting an In-N-Out Burger or a Target and easily reading the signage when I walk into a shop.\\n\\nBut my wife and I are very spiritual and practice gratitude, constantly reminding ourselves how fortunate we are to live this lifestyle.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nWe already have the next year planned out: We'll be in Malaysia until December 22, then go back to Bali, where we'll stay at a hotel on the bluff with an ocean view for only $26 a night. We'll spend 60 days in the country, then another 60-day window in a country we've yet to decide on, before heading to Europe.\\n\\nIn April, we'll fly to Greece to pick up a motorcycle in nearby Romania. For several months, we'll ride through Greece and then take a ferry to Italy to explore Southern Italy, Sicily, Malta, and Sardinia.\\n\\nThe Petronas Towers in Kuala Lumpur, where Bour is living. Courtesy of Norman Bour\\n\\nThen it's back to the Balkans for a few months in Eastern Europe, and then we'll probably head back to Asia.\\n\\nIn the months before leaving the US, I created my blog, Travel Younger. The goal is to teach anyone over 50 how to travel smartly.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nBefore I came to Europe, I recognized that young people made traveling look so easy. This was quite intimidating as an older person who was not very experienced as a traveler. I said: \\\"I need to learn how to travel like them. I need to learn how to travel younger.\\\"\\n\\nThe blog is not a revenue generator; it's just one way of giving back.\\n\\nMany people my age are starting to think outside the box and recognize that they can take their $3,000-a-month income in the US and live nomadically and affordably elsewhere. I want to show them this isn't the world they remember 50 years ago.\\n\\nI feel that having new experiences keeps us all mentally young.\"\n",

The share of debt banks have written off as a loss because they couldn't collect it has also ticked up, with the charge-off rate for two of these three loan types the highest they've been in more than a decade.\\n\\nBusiness Insider spoke with industry insiders who said this had prompted a response from big banks anticipating a continued increase in bad loans. US banks have increased their reserves in recent years, effectively setting aside cash to cover loan losses.\\n\\nWhile it's commonplace for banks to increase their reserves as loan levels rise over time, reserves have started gradually making up a bigger share of total loans at firms such as Wells Fargo, Bank of America, JPMorgan, and Citigroup. Since June 2022, Wells Fargo's and Bank of America's reserves have risen by about $1.8 billion and $2.4 billion, respectively. Still, for context, these firms' cash coffers are still considerably lighter than they were during the Great Recession.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAmerica's 3 debt pain points\\n\\nEach month, the New York Fed asks roughly 1,300 Americans to estimate the chance they'll be unable to make a minimum debt payment over the next three months. Aside from the pandemic, Americans haven't been this pessimistic since 2017.\\n\\nConsumers' struggles to repay credit-card and auto debt suggest that inflation and interest rates, while moderating in recent months, are still taking a toll on their finances. Additionally, businesses' struggles to pack back commercial-real-estate debt indicate that factors like elevated interest rates and the remote-work revolution are having lingering effects.\\n\\nHere's a closer look at each of the three debt categories:\\n\\nRelated stories\\n\\nCredit-card debt\\n\\nAs of the second quarter of this year, more than 3% of all credit-card accounts in the US had past-due balances, the Federal Reserve Board found \\u2014 up from less than 2% in 2021.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThe steady uptick in past-due credit-card debt over such a short period provides some cause for concern, Bruce McClary, a credit counselor and senior vice president at the nonprofit National Foundation for Credit Counseling, told BI.\\n\\n\\\"What we are seeing is that people are struggling to repay debt while continuing to use up what is left of their available credit \\u2014 forcing more people to start falling behind on their payments and into the hands of debt collectors,\\\" he said.\\n\\nDavid Schiff, a senior managing director at FTI, told BI that prolonged debt-repayment problems would eventually present a bigger risk to the economy.\\n\\nThe increase in reserves raises \\\"real concerns about the softness of certain assets classes \\u2014 specifically ongoing uncertainty around the commercial-real-estate market and increasing worry about the number of revolving credit-card customers and their rapidly growing balances,\\\" Schiff told BI.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAuto debt\\n\\nA Federal Reserve report published on September 26 found that auto-loan delinquency rates rose \\\"substantially\\\" above pre-pandemic levels by the end of 2023, driven in large part by growth in monthly debt payments.\\n\\nIn fact, a growing number of Americans owe more than their cars are worth, a report published on Tuesday by the automotive website Edmunds said. Stephen Biggar, the director of financial-services research at Argus Research, told BI that if a bank is forced to repossess such a vehicle, the car's value wouldn't even cover the loan, resulting in losses to the bank. He said that the uptick in auto delinquencies was \\\"not a spike but is kind of a concern about what goes on from here.\\\"\\n\\nCommercial-real-estate debt\\n\\nAnother problem for banks is that some businesses with commercial-real-estate loans are struggling to repay them. Biggar said some of this was tied to high vacancy rates among offices. While many companies have called employees back to the office since the height of the pandemic, office vacancy rates still rose to record highs over the past year.\\n\\nElevated interest rates have also made it difficult for businesses to pay back commercial-real-estate loans related to office, retail, hotel, and apartment-building properties, among others. That's because some loans are coming due \\u2014 forcing businesses to refinance at much higher interest rates.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nTo be sure, we're still far from a debt crisis: The share of past-due and charged-off debt generally remains in line with historical levels after rising from pandemic-era lows. Additionally, some banks are simply restoring reserves that were depleted during the pandemic. However, if the economy slows and the unemployment rate rises further, the uptick in delinquencies could become a larger concern, Biggar said.\\n\\nWall Street acknowledgment\\n\\nWhile banking executives this earnings season generally spoke highly of the economy, they did acknowledge that elevated prices and interest rates continued to weigh on American consumers.\\n\\n\\\"Our customers are healthy but more discerning in their spend with signs of stress isolated,\\\" Jane Fraser, Citi's CEO, said, referring to consumers with lower credit scores.\\n\\nBrian Moynihan, Bank of America's CEO, said that overall consumer spending remained strong but that \\\"consumers are worried of the cost of living, worried about higher rates, and other matters.\\\"\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nCharles Scharf, Wells Fargo's CEO, said the bank hadn't seen \\\"meaningful changes\\\" in delinquency rates across its credit portfolio but that there's evidence of financial strain among some Americans.\\n\\n\\\"We continue to see more pronounced stress in certain customer segments with lower deposit and asset levels where inflation has partially offset strong employment and wage growth,\\\" he said.\\n\\nJeremy Barnum, JPMorgan's CFO, said that consumers' discretionary spending had \\\"normalized\\\" following particularly strong levels in recent years.\\n\\nThe financial roller coaster of pandemic payments, inflation, and high interest rates is especially affecting lower-income Americans.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\\"We know consumers at a certain income level and below are strapped,\\\" Biggar said, adding, \\\"There's been a lot of concern, particularly at the lower-income category, that people are unable to make ends meet.\\\"\\n\\nGoing forward, Biggar said, many banks could continue adding to their reserves, particularly if the unemployment rate rises further. That might not ultimately be necessary, since the jobless rate has stabilized over the past two months after a surprise increase.\\n\\n\\\"I'm not expecting any big spike from here unless the unemployment rate moves materially higher,\\\" Biggar said of further reserve reinforcements.\"\n",

      "            \"text\": \"European company executives might be even more preoccupied than their US counterparts about Donald Trump\\u2019s promise to impose tariffs on all imports if he retakes the White House.\\n\\nMentions of \\u201ctariff\\u201d on earnings conference calls so far this period have soared in Europe, outpacing instances on US calls by a ratio of 5 to 2 in October. By far, the characterizations are negative. The chief financial officer of French spirits maker Pernod Ricard said the company will \\u201cadapt\\u201d to global tariffs when there is more clarity. Volvo Car AB\\u2019s chief executive officer said trade levies are complicating the outlook for profitability.\\n\\nThere\\u2019s good reason for all the consternation over a word the Republican candidate has declared \\u201cbeautiful\\u201d and his favorite in the dictionary. Investors and market strategists see a Trump victory as the worst outcome for European equities because of his intention to restrict imports into the US. America is the European Union\\u2019s largest trading partner by far, with total trade amounting to $952 billion in 2023, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\\n\\nA raft of Wall Street economists have warned that Trump\\u2019s tariff-hike plans will send inflation higher and curb economic growth, particularly if US trading partners retaliate. A Morgan Stanley model indicated a 0.9 percentage point bump in inflation over 12 months, and a 1.4 percentage-point hit to GDP growth over several quarters.\\n\\n\\u201cIf tariff threats come in hard and fast, and Europe retaliates with its own counter tariffs, we will look back at the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act passed in the 1930s which worsened the Great Depression,\\u201d said Rajeev De Mello, chief investment officer at Gama Asset Management. \\u201cThat would be very negative for European equities.\\u201d\\n\\nMeanwhile, potential tax increases under a Democrat Kamala Harris administration could give European stocks the edge. That\\u2019s because they would take a bite out of S&P 500 company earnings, potentially eroding their attractiveness to investors.\\n\\nEuropean stocks are lagging far behind their US peers this year. The earnings season is off to a shaky start, and there are major doubts over whether China\\u2019s stimulus efforts can boost the region\\u2019s faltering economy. US voters are already casting early ballots for next month\\u2019s too-close-to-call election, and the potential return of Trump would add to the list of headwinds.\\n\\nRepresentatives for the Harris and Trump campaigns declined to comment.\\n\\nTrump has proclaimed that he would target countries like China with tariffs of anywhere from 60% to 100%, with a 10% across-the-board levy on imports from elsewhere. These may yet prove to be opening positions for negotiation, but memories are still fresh of the effect a strategy like that can have on companies and stocks.\\n\\n\\u201cIn the event of a Trump victory, you would want to be long US small caps and you probably want to be short European companies that depend on exporting to consumers,\\u201d said Guy Stear, head of developed markets strategy at the Amundi Investment Institute. \\u201cThese companies have done poorly over the past three to six months and can continue to do poorly.\\u201d\\n\\nEuropean equities trailed their US counterparts in local currency terms in all the years Trump was president, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The mining sector came under particular pressure in 2018 as the then-president hit European steel and aluminum exports with tariffs.\\n\\n\\u201cIn a worst-case scenario of a full-blown tariff war with retaliation, we estimate potential for a mid to high single-digit drag on European earnings-per-share growth,\\u201d Barclays Plc strategists led by Emmanuel Cau wrote in a note. A \\u201cbig chunk\\u201d of consensus forecasts of more than 10% growth in earnings next year could be wiped out by a spat over levies on trade, they said.\\n\\nBy country, Germany and Italy look most at risk given their higher goods surplus with the US, according to the Barclays team. Among sectors, capital goods, automotives, beverages, technology, and chemicals face the greatest threat.\\n\\nWhen it comes to taxes, Trump has promised to cut the federal corporate rate to 15% from 21%, a move that would be a boost for US stocks, while Harris proposes raising it to 28%. But tariffs are the issue uppermost on the minds of executives outside the US, as these are in the purview of the President, while any changes in tax policy require the approval of Congress.\\n\\n\\u201cA newly elected Mr. Trump could theoretically have a lot of power to assess in short order,\\u201d said Carol Schleif, chief investment officer at BMO Family Office. \\u201cHe has effectively put the EU, China, and other manufacturers on notice that if one wants to sell to US citizens, the products or services should be produced \\u2014 not just assembled \\u2014 in the US.\\u201d\\n\\nA tariff onslaught from a Trump Presidency is the last thing Europe\\u2019s auto sector needs right now. Volkswagen AG, Mercedes-Benz Group AG and BMW AG have all just reported a slump in sales in the key China market, while Jeep maker Stellantis NV has joined its peers in slashing its profit forecast. It\\u2019s the worst-performing Stoxx 600 sector in 2024.\\n\\nTrump has vowed to boost the US auto industry by making interest on car loans fully tax-deductible. He has also said he would prevent cars made by China across the border in Mexico from being sold in America, imposing \\u201cwhatever tariffs are required\\u201d to do so \\u2014 even as high as 1,000%.\\n\\n\\u201cThe additional tariffs on China imports could see a second-order negative effect on European stocks exposed to China, like materials and autos, although the sentiment toward these segments is already quite depressed,\\u201d said Leonardo Pellandini, equity strategist at Bank Julius Baer.\\n\\nStill, there are some sectors that could benefit from Trump\\u2019s policies. Oddo BHF strategist Thomas Zlowodzki said media as well as oil and oil services are likely to be supported. In the case of a Harris win, the strategist said the sectors to play are metals, aerospace and defense as well as capital goods.\\n\\nThe Stoxx Europe 600 is expected to climb nearly 2% by the end of the year, according to a Bloomberg survey of strategists. But the US elections are seen as a wild card. UBS Group AG strategist Gerry Fowler said rising risk premia and potential tariffs may mean that European banks, the best-performing subgroup this year with a gain of 23%, would be among the most vulnerable sectors, and investors should consider hedging.\\n\\nWith the vote outcome this unclear, one thing is certain: investors should prepare for volatility in the build-up to Nov. 5. Citigroup Inc. strategists led by Beata Manthey advise caution and waiting before returning to sectors that should benefit from economic growth.\\n\\n\\u201cBased on Trump\\u2019s first term, it could well be that the tariff threat is a negotiating tactic and we avoid a tariff escalation,\\u201d Gama\\u2019s De Mello said. \\u201cThe more credible his threat, the more likely he could get concessions, so the initial phase could be rough.\\u201d\"\n",

But immigrants who have been in the country for decades say a nuanced issue has been drowned out by seemingly simpler solutions championed by both parties.\\n\\nNowhere are the complicated economic and social realities behind the searing-hot political divide on immigration more clear than in Nevada, a toss-up state that could decide an increasingly close election.\\n\\nHere are highlights from the AP\\u2019s report:\\n\\nHow immigration has shaped the presidential race\\n\\nThe influx of illegal border crossings long strained city and state resources even in Democratic strongholds across the country, even as encounters between immigrants and law enforcement officials have declined sharply in recent months. And yet, immigration has fueled job growth in ways that strengthen the economy and improve the federal government\\u2019s fiscal health.\\n\\nFormer President Donald Trump is championing hardline proposals that would force mass deportations, while Vice President Kamala Harris is calling for pathways to citizenship for millions of people in the country illegally. But Harris is also calling for increased funding for border security enforcement and strengthening existing Biden administration actions that tightened rules for immigrants to seek asylum in the U.S. when they arrive at the southern border.\\n\\n\\u201cI think that our focus is completely directed into the border and not toward the people who are already here and have been here for many, many years,\\u201d said Erika Marquez, immigrant justice organizer for the advocacy group Make the Road Nevada.\\n\\nBipartisan support for guest workers \\u2014 to a point\\n\\nBoth parties have called for expanding guest worker programs in agriculture.\\n\\nThe Trump administration deemed guest farmworkers essential during the coronavirus pandemic, and the program\\u2019s participation rose while he was in office. But he also proposed a rule freezing farmworkers\\u2019 salaries for two years, loosening requirements for worker housing and restricting the transportation costs they could be reimbursed for.\\n\\nThe Biden administration wiped out those rules. Since then, more than 310,000 H-2A visas were issued in fiscal year 2023, compared to around 213,000 in fiscal year 2020, the last full one under Trump. But the Biden White House also imposed a series of new rules meant to better protect workers that have occasionally frustrated business owners like the Bakers.\\n\\n\\u201cIt is a hot potato and each side\\u2019s lobbing one at the other. And, in all honesty, both are to blame,\\u201d Janille Baker, who runs the ranch\\u2019s financial books, said of immigration. \\u201cThere is going to come a point where it has to get taken care of. You can\\u2019t just keep using fearmongering and scaring people, and then being critical of the people who do or don\\u2019t want to do whatever jobs.\\u201d\\n\\nA state economy powered by immigrants\\n\\nIn Nevada, nearly 19% of residents are foreign-born and 9% of the total workforce does not have U.S. legal status. If the state lost all of its workers in the country illegally, Labor Department figures suggest the direct job losses would be roughly as large as those from the 2008 financial crisis, which stalled tourism, triggered a wave of housing market foreclosures and cost the state about 9.3% of its jobs during the subsequent Great Recession.\\n\\n\\u201cIn our wonderful, 24-hour economy, we know that these hotels and casinos could not, should not, would not be able to open every day without immigrants,\\u201d said Peter Guzman, president and CEO of the Latin Chamber of Commerce in Nevada.\\n\\nAnd even rounding up people in the country illegally might not count those with temporary protected status, or the guest workers on Baker ranch, all of whom are authorized to be in the U.S.\\n\\nHaydee Zetino, who scrubs lavish hotel suites at Harrah\\u2019s Casino on the famed Las Vegas strip, is an immigrant from El Salvador with only temporary protected status in the U.S. The 62-year-old saw Trump try to strip away many such protections during his first term and worries it could happen again if he wins \\u2014 even as she can\\u2019t vote herself as a non-citizen.\\n\\n\\u201cThese people don\\u2019t have any conscience,\\u201d she said of mass deportation supporters. \\u201cThey believe they can lift up the country, move the economy forward, but they don\\u2019t think of those at the bottom.\\u201d\\n\\nA small state that could be a big factor on Election Day\\n\\nThe Pew Research Center estimates that 11 million people in the country illegally live in the U.S. Big states like California, Texas and Florida have larger numbers who potentially could have even more influence on workforces and communities. But all of those states are all solidly red or blue in presidential races \\u2014 and aren\\u2019t likely to sway the election as toss-up Nevada might.\\n\\nDespite having just six electoral votes, Nevada could go for either Trump or Harris. Clark County, encompassing Las Vegas, is about 75% of the state\\u2019s population and includes a sizeable number of hospitality industry workers represented by Nevada\\u2019s powerful Culinary Union, which has endorsed Harris.\\n\\nBut Trump was able to turn out infrequent voters there in 2020, and did well in much of the rest of the state, which is rural and more conservative. Washoe County, home to Reno, is a perennial toss-up. Voters can also choose \\u201cNone\\u201d of the presidential candidates, adding to the Nevada electorate\\u2019s famously fickle nature.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s all left some voters afraid of what the outcome might be.\\n\\n\\u201cThere\\u2019s a lot of fear,\\u201d said Nancy Valenzuela, a 48-year-old maid who works at the Strat casino. \\u201cThere are people who don\\u2019t have papers. They\\u2019re like, \\u2018They want to throw us all out.\\u2019\\u201d\"\n",

We have upgraded US equities to Attractive from neutral,\\\" strategists said in a note on Friday, pointing to data that suggested the economy was on a solid bedrock.\\n\\nThe job market is proving resilient, despite tighter financial conditions and higher interest rates. The US added 254,000 jobs in September, way more than the expected 147,000, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The jobless rate, meanwhile, remained near historic lows, with unemployment dipping to 4.1%.\\n\\nEconomic activity also remains robust. Retail sales grew an above-expected 0.4% over the month of September, and GDP expanded 3% year-over-year in the second quarter.\\n\\nInflation, meanwhile, is moving closer to the Fed's 2% target. Consumer prices grew 2.4% annually in September, while personal consumption expenditures inflation, the Fed's preferred inflation measure, grew 2.2% year-over-year in August, its lowest reading since 2021.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nCooling price growth sets the stage for the Fed to continue cutting interest rates, UBS said, which is bullish for stocks. Markets are pricing in a 72% chance the Fed will cut rates another 50 basis points by the end of year, according to the CME Fedwatch tool.\\n\\nThe strategists added that while investors may see some volatility ahead of the November election, it's unlikely to interrupt more positive market catalysts.\\n\\n\\\"The US presidential election is unlikely to derail positive fundamentals. We expect volatility to rise in the runup to the election as neither party holds a clear advantage in any of the key swing states that will decide the outcome. But the election is taking place against a backdrop of Fed rate cuts, US economic momentum, and supportive secular trends like artificial intelligence (AI),\\\" the note added.\\n\\nOther forecasters have said a \\\"no landing\\\" is looking to be more likely, given the underlying strength of the US economy. Still, the New York Fed sees a 57% chance of the economy tipping into a downturn by September 2025.\"\n",

Now, the company is expanding a crucial product from its lineup to U.K. customers.\\n\\nRobinhood has launched margin trading for U.K. customers six months after its app first launched in the country.\\n\\nMargin trading, another word for leveraged trading, allows retail traders to increase the size of their position through a loan from a broker, increasing the potential rewards of a successful trade.\\n\\nRobinhood was a niche brokerage for much of its first seven years in operation after forming in 2013. It won over customers with what it said was true commission-free trading, arguing competitors offered a commission-free model while charging hidden fees.\\n\\nHowever, it became a household name in 2021 when Redditors gathered on the subreddit \\u201cWallStreetBets\\u201d to drive the \\u201cmeme stock\\u201d craze.\\n\\nThe most famous example was GameStop. Institutional investors heavily bet against the brick-and-mortar gaming store, forecasting long-term decline as digital gaming proliferated.\\n\\nNostalgic Redditors, however, saw the stock differently and overwhelmed investors by buying up options in GameStop. The shift caused a \\u201cshort squeeze\\u201d as institutional investors closed their short positions, driving the price up higher.\\n\\nRobinhood was the brokerage of choice for many of these Redditors, who used margin trading to increase their bets on the business. It also alerted a new generation of young traders to the potential for a quick profit.\\n\\nRobinhood now has 24 million customers in the U.S. The group reported record revenues of $682 million and net income of $188 million in the second quarter of 2024.\\n\\nU.K. retail traders\\n\\nRobinhood expanded to the U.K. in March with its commission-free stock trading offering. The company had briefly promised margin trading but took this down from its website afters it launched, thanks to regulatory hurdles.\\n\\nJordan Sinclar, Robinhood\\u2019s U.K. president, didn\\u2019t elaborate on the regulatory challenges that caused the delay in the rollout of leveraged trading.\\n\\n\\u201cIn the U.S., we\\u2019ve had this product for a long time, and I guess that probably demonstrates that it just has taken a little bit of time with regulators to get them comfortable with your product, the education, the rates, how it\\u2019s delivered to customers,\\u201d Sinclair told Fortune.\\n\\nThe company has also brought 24/5 trading to its U.K. customers, allowing them to trade around the clock alongside retail traders in the U.S.\\n\\n\\u201cEarnings volatility is probably something we see more and more. And traditionally, U.K. customers can\\u2019t access the markets,\\u201d Sinclair told Fortune.\\n\\nFor now, U.K. traders will be able to trade U.S. stocks with leverage. U.K. stocks are not yet available to trade on the platform, though Sinclair didn\\u2019t explain the reasons why. Sinclair promised new products for U.K. customers were in the pipeline.\\n\\n\\u201cWould we like to do it tomorrow? Yes, absolutely,\\u201d he said.\\n\\nCompetitors like IG and Plus500 also offer margin trading in the U.K. Robinhood is keen to expand its appeal beyond retail trading and offer itself as a long-term investment platform for U.K. customers.\\n\\nSinclair said the U.K. has traditionally been more \\u201cconservative\\u201d than the U.S. when it comes to investing, something he hopes to help change.\\n\\n\\u201cWe don\\u2019t have a culture quite comparable in terms of talking about stocks from the age of 16, having a 401K that you\\u2019re always kind of thinking about, even just engagement with news and the market and what the stocks are doing,\\u201d he said.\\n\\nTrader\\u2019s remorse\\n\\nRobinhood\\u2019s gradual expansion follows a turbulent number of years for the platform, where it has grown users and revenues by millions while courting its fair share of controversy.\\n\\nIn June 2021, Robinhood was ordered to pay $57 million to the U.S. Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and another $12.6 million plus interest in restitution to customers after providing misleading information to customers on margin trading. It was the largest punishment ever doled out by the regulator.\\n\\nThe platform suffered outages on its app during the pandemic and was forced to settle a lawsuit with customers who said they missed out on trading potentially lucrative volatility.\\n\\nRobinhood has marketed itself as a platform that democratizes finance and opens trading access beyond the traditionally murky institutional finance sector, which is backed by market-moving levels of liquidity.\\n\\nSinclair says that historically, just under half of users carry out their first ever trade with Robinhood. However, that democratization has opened the door to young, inexperienced retails traders who might otherwise have avoided getting involved in the unforgiving day trading market.\\n\\nBrokers often warn traders they should be prepared to lose all the money they have invested when buying a stock. Short-selling using leverage, however, means an investor could lose much more than 100% of their position if a stock increases, leaving them in significant levels of debt.\\n\\nSuccessful retail traders, while a compelling example for novices, are rare. Disclosures from several brokerages have shown more than 70% of retail traders lose money.\\n\\nThe New York Times spoke to Robinhood traders in 2020, who said they were lured in by the gamified aspects of the app like emoji-laden, but many were left with excessive debt as their trades went sour.\\n\\nSinclair explained the company was offering two-to-one leverage in the U.K., but \\u201conly for the right customers.\\u201d Traders need a minimum of $2,000 to open an account, and can only loan 50% of their holdings to trade on leverage.\\n\\n\\u201cWhat we really want to do is make sure customers always have the right information, and for us, is to make sure that customers aren\\u2019t making losses.\\u201d\\n\\nHe added that customers who first joined the platform thanks to the meme stock craze had largely stayed and \\u201cgrown up\\u201d with the broker and now held retirement saving accounts with Robinhood.\\n\\nRobinhood also plans to expand its presence as an educational platform to empower traders in the U.K.\\n\\nThe company has a separate news service that provides stock analysis. It is currently hiring for a data reporter based in London, according to a LinkedIn job advertisement.\"\n",

That would put it in the 7th percentile of performance since 1930. It would also badly lag the 13% annualized figure put up by the benchmark index over the prior decade, Goldman data showed.\\n\\n\\\"Investors should be prepared for equity returns during the next decade that are towards the lower end of their typical performance distribution relative to bonds and inflation,\\\" the analysts wrote.\\n\\nAs an extension of this forecast, Goldman also sees stocks struggling to outperform other assets over the next 10 years. By its calculation, the S&P 500 has about a 72% chance of trailing bonds and a 33% probability of lagging inflation through 2034.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nFive factors underline Goldman's lackluster outlook:\\n\\nFirst, a historically stretched stock-market valuation implies lower future returns, the bank said. Current valuations are indeed elevated, with the cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio at 38 times, or in the 97th percentile.\\n\\nThe S&P 500's CAPE ratio has averaged 22%, Goldman said.\\n\\nGoldman Sachs\\n\\nSecond, market concentration is near its highest level in 100 years, Goldman said.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\\"When equity market concentration is high, performance of the aggregate index is strongly dictated by the prospects of a few stocks,\\\" the analysts wrote.\\n\\nThese stocks include tech large caps such as Nvidia and Alphabet, whose performance has driven the S&P 500 more than 20% higher year to date. While that's led the index through a string of record highs this year, it fosters a market mired in volatility risk and in need of diversity.\\n\\n\\\"Our historical analyses show that it is extremely difficult for any firm to maintain high levels of sales growth and profit margins over sustained periods of time. The same issue plagues a highly concentrated index,\\\" Goldman said.\\n\\nWhile some may find reason to argue why tech stocks will maintain growth momentum, history suggests that revenue will slow. Goldman said that S&P 500 firms that had consistently generated over 20% revenue growth underwent a sharp drop off after 10 years.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nGoldman Sachs\\n\\nThird, Goldman expects the economy to contract more frequently for the next decade. The firm said the US would see four GDP contractions over the period, or in 10% of quarters. That's up from two such instances during the previous decade.\\n\\nGoldman added that annualized equity returns typically averaged minus 10% during these periods of economic slowdown.\\n\\nGoldman Sachs\\n\\nThe fourth headwind factored into Goldman's forward-return model is corporate profitability. The firm tied its rationale in with the concentration argument above, saying that as sales and earnings growth decelerate for the market's biggest stocks, that will have an outsize impact on the entire market.\\n\\nFinally, the fifth is the relative level of the 10-year Treasury yield. The 10-year is yielding north of 4% as investors recalibrate their rate-cut expectations following a series of strong economic-data reports and amid persistently hot inflation.\"\n",

TSMC has begun producing A16 chips for Apple at one of its Phoenix semiconductor chip fabs (or factories), two people familiar with the matter told BI. This development bodes well for the future of the US semiconductor industry, to which the Biden administration pledged $52 billion. Donald Trump weighs in on Google's antitrust challenges. In an interview with Bloomberg, the former president said Google \\\"has a lot of power\\\" and he would do \\\"something\\\" about it, but didn't say he favored a break-up .

It has a giant subscriber base and a towering lead over its rivals (most of which are still struggling to figure out a profitable streaming model), and its stock price recently hit a record high.\\n\\nStill, that gargantuan comeback \\u2014 it hit $725 a share earlier this month after falling below $180 in summer 2022 following a rare subscriber loss \\u2014 has some investors asking whether the company is worth its high price tag. After all, Netflix still trails YouTube in terms of TV watch time, and its share of total TV viewing, per Nielsen, hasn't materially changed over the past year. Amazon threw a wrench into Netflix's advertising ambitions by steamrolling into the market earlier this year.\\n\\nNetflix has already made clear to investors that weaker subscriber growth may be ahead as the benefits of its password-sharing crackdown taper off, writing in its second-quarter shareholder letter: \\\"We expect paid net additions to be lower than Q3'23, which had the first full quarter impact from paid sharing.\\\"\\n\\nWhile some analysts think Netflix could grow revenue by as much as 15% in 2025, others are more tepid. Barclays even gave the stock a rare downgrade on October 7, writing that it would be harder for Netflix to grow revenue over time and that every growth lever comes with trade-offs.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAhead of Netflix's third-quarter earnings report on Thursday, here are the top questions on Wall Street's mind about how Netflix can keep its growth going and live up to its sky-high valuation.\\n\\nWhere will future revenue come from?\\n\\nFor all of Netflix's expansion overseas, the US and Canada remain by far its biggest growth engine, accounting for 70% of revenue growth from 2019 to 2023, Barclays analysts wrote this month.\\n\\nHow much growth is left?\\n\\nThe benefits of Netflix's password-sharing crackdown will fade over time, which could weigh down subscriber growth.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nNetflix is also counting on the US and Canada to drive advertising growth, but Barclays said this could come with trade-offs in either lower revenue (if more people choose its ad tier) or lower subscriber growth (if Netflix raises prices to compensate for that).\\n\\nHow is advertising going?\\n\\nIf subscriber growth is limited in the US because Netflix is already quite saturated in the market, Netflix needs to ramp up ad revenue. This is a point that analysts have been making for a while, and Netflix has made progress, announcing a 150% increase in ad commitments at this year's TV upfronts (off a small base). It's also opening up advertising sales through tech partnerships and deals to broadcast live events such as the Tyson-Paul fight, two NFL Christmas Day games, and WWE fights \\u2014 all things that are catnip to advertisers.\\n\\nRelated stories\\n\\nNetflix execs have said that they expect advertising to eventually account for at least 10% of the company's revenue. But the ad-tier base is still relatively small (15 million in the US and Canada, LightShed Partners estimated). It needs a lot more subscribers to become a meaningful contributor to revenue, though how much is unclear.\\n\\nWhile Netflix's ad-tier growth is steadily adding inventory, those tech deals will take a couple of years to ramp up. The WWE partnership won't start until 2025. And as part of its effort to attract advertisers, Netflix is spending to acquire more ad-friendly content such as live sports (as well as to build a video-gaming library), which could increase its content costs and cut into its margins.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nMeanwhile, Amazon came on strong when it rolled out ads by default across Prime Video this year, putting downward pressure on Netflix's and other streamers' ad rates.\\n\\nBarclays wrote that forcing people to watch more ads could also have a downside for Netflix: \\\"It's tough to see how this doesn't come with its own engagement trade-offs.\\\"\\n\\nAre price increases coming?\\n\\nOne way Netflix can keep growing revenue if subscriber and advertiser growth are limited is to raise prices for customers. There's broad consensus among Wall Street analysts that Netflix has room to do so, given its relative value in the market and price increases by its peers.\\n\\nCitibank analysts said Netflix could raise US prices by 12%. But a US price increase would only do so much for Netflix, given its ability to raise prices overseas is limited, Citibank wrote.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nNetflix last raised prices in October 2023, on its premium and basic tiers, but not its ad-supported or standard plans.\\n\\nIt has the lowest cancellation rate, research from the data firm Antenna found, and the lowest-priced ad tier of the streamers, so it has a lot of credit with subscribers on this front.\\n\\nSo the question is more when prices will go up \\u2014 not if.\\n\\nOr, as NewStreet analysts wrote, is it possible Netflix could go in the opposite direction, at least in some markets? The streamer could decrease prices in small markets to build penetration or launch a free, fully ad-supported tier in select markets.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nWhat's happening with games?\\n\\nNetflix has been building out a video-game library since 2021 but has shared little data on its progress.\\n\\nMeanwhile, questions persist inside and outside the company about what the strategy around games is and whether they're worth the investment.\\n\\nThe company recently installed a gaming leader from Epic Games who has already begun shaking things up.\\n\\nWith doubts about where Netflix's next growth act could come from, don't be surprised if questions grow louder about the games business, such as how efforts to promote games on the home screen have paid off and how Netflix might be looking to monetize them.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nWhat's next?\\n\\nFor all the talk of Netflix's dominance, the overarching question looming for the company is how it moves from what's long been a single business model \\u2014 selling subscriptions \\u2014 to multiple business lines. Beyond advertising and games, the company also has been putting on events and selling merch tied to its popular shows like \\\"Bridgerton,\\\" areas that they say are about building fandom and retaining subscribers.\\n\\n\\\"But those are business lines at Disney,\\\" Dan Salmon of NewStreet said in an interview. \\\"If you think about the next five, 10 years, that's the question: Do they build all the ancillary businesses like Disney has to leverage their IP?\\\"\\n\\nIt's worth noting that Netflix recently hired Lowell Singer, a longtime investor-relations exec from none other than Disney.\\n\\nThere's also an inconvenient truth looming for Netflix.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nDespite Netflix ticking up in Piper Sandler's latest teen survey, kids spend more time watching short video clips on mobile screens versus TV shows and movies, which are Netflix's bread and butter.\\n\\nNetflix will have to evolve to meet that generation as it grows into adulthood and when \\u2014 or if \\u2014 its members become subscribers on their own.\\n\\nBut those are questions that won't be solved in the next quarter.\\n\\nCorrection: October 18, 2024 \\u2014 This story was updated to clarify when Netflix most recently raised prices. It was October 2023, not October 2024.\"\n",

It's welcome news for a company whose earnings have consistently underwhelmed forecasts over the last two years. The last time JB Hunt exceeded the consensus EPS forecast was the third quarter of 2022.\\n\\nIt's a promising signal that the prolonged US trucking-industry recession is easing and demand in the sector is returning, albeit gradually. JB Hunt specifically mentioned demand in its biggest business \\u2014 intermodal service \\u2014 had improved throughout the third quarter.\\n\\nThe firm \\u2014 considered a freight industry bellwether \\u2014 has been among many suffering from an extensive post-pandemic trucking slowdown. With low demand and oversupplied trucking fleets, this so-called recession has bankrupted thousands of carriers and trucking brokers.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThese struggles have translated into weak market performance for JB Hunt and other freight carriers. Even with Wednesday's sharp move higher, the company's stock is still down roughly 10% year-to-date, badly trailing a 23% return for the benchmark S&P 500.\\n\\n\\\"We continue to navigate a challenging freight environment,\\\" JB Hunt CEO Shelley Simpson acknowledged in the firm's earnings conference call on Tuesday, but followed up with a positive take: \\\"As discussed last quarter, we have seen a return to more normal seasonal demand patterns as evidenced across our businesses in the third quarter.\\\"\\n\\nRelated stories\\n\\nChief operating officer Nicholas Hobbs added: \\\"Our sales pipeline remains strong, and our team has worked hard to backfill most of those truck losses we have experienced this year.\\\"\\n\\nHe added that 258 trucks were sold in new deals over the quarter and cited a significant pickup in customer locations, boosting the firm's trucking margins.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nGoing beyond JB Hunt, there has been other data suggesting better prospects ahead.\\n\\nDAT Freight & Analytics' trucking volume index rose year-over-year for all three different categories of freight equipment for the 12 months ended in September.\\n\\n\\\"We're firmly into a new freight cycle after nearly 22 months of rather extreme expansion and 27 months of contraction,\\\" Ken Adamo, DAT chief of analytics, said in a release on Wednesday.\\n\\n\\\"We expect seasonality to provide some tailwinds over the next few months, and hopefully modest improvements in rates coupled with retail freight volumes and stable fuel prices can get the motor carrier base on more solid footing,\\\" he added.\"\n",

On Monday, it notched its 46th all-time high of 2024.\\n\\nUBS strategists Jonathan Golub and Patrick Palfrey upped their 5,600 price target to 5,850 for the end of the year, marking their fourth upgrade since late last year.\\n\\nThe target is just slightly above the level the index is trading at on Wednesday, but the analysts forecast a 9% rise in the next 15 months and raised their target for 2025 from 6,000 to 6,400 in a note on Tuesday.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nEarlier this month, meanwhile, Goldman Sachs raised its target on the index to 6,000 by December, marking the fourth increase since late last year. The call, from the firm's chief equity strategist David Kostin, is the second highest among those tracked by Bloomberg.\\n\\nKostin said the estimates were driven by a steady macro outlook and greater margin expansion.\\n\\n\\\"The primary driver of the upward revision to our 2025 EPS estimate is greater margin expansion,\\\" Kostin said, adding, \\\"The macro backdrop remains conducive to modest margin expansion, with prices charged outpacing input cost growth.\\\"\\n\\nKostin's price target is just behind that of BMO's chief equity strategist, Brian Belski, who raised his forecast from 5,600 to 6,100 last month. Belski's new target implies a nearly 5% gain through the rest of this year.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nBelski said his upgrade was based on strong market gains so far this year, which he says typically leads to stronger-than-normal gains in the fourth quarter.\\n\\n\\\"We continue to be surprised by the strength of market gains and decided yet again that something more than an incremental adjustment was warranted,\\\" Belski said in a note.\\n\\nHe added that Federal Reserve easing and a broadening market rally will only help fuel further gains.\\n\\nDeutsche Bank also raised its year-end target for the S&P 500 last month, up to 5,750 from 5,500. The bank's strategists pointed to strong corporate earnings and inflows, rising stock buybacks, and higher risk sentiment.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\\"We see S&P 500 earnings growth continuing to run robustly in the low double digits, in line with typical growth rates outside of recessions,\\\" the strategists said in a note.\\n\\nThe strategists' target raises come amid a chorus of strategists turning decidedly more upbeat on the market. JPMorgan's chief equity strategist Dubravko Lakos-Bujas recently recommended investors should get less defensive after a strong September jobs report.\\n\\n\\\"While it is too soon to assume that this is a turning point, it does suggest that a recession is unlikely in the near term, especially since surprisingly strong job growth and a downtick in the unemployment rate broke a slowing trend in the job market,\\\" he said in a note earlier this month.\\n\\nLakos-Bujas kept his 4,200 price target for the S&P 500 unchanged, though.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThe more upbeat 2024 forecasts come as the bull market charges on, with the S&P 500 up 3.2% in the last month and 22.6% this year. Several risks persist, though, with the upcoming US presidential election in November, an unclear trajectory of monetary policy easing from the Fed as economic data comes in mixed, and as war in the Middle East continues to threaten stability in the region and beyond.\\n\\n\\\"Fiscal and monetary policy uncertainty, and potential election outcomes, make 2025 returns far from certain,\\\" UBS analysts said.\"\n",

It's up around 34% in the last 12 months, which is about 10 percentage points better than each of its smaller counterparts.\\n\\nSo-called SMID caps seemed poised to take the baton from large caps over the summer. However, a head-turning rally in July \\u2014 which was one of the cohort's best months in decades on a relative basis, according to BMO \\u2014 soon fizzled.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAlthough smaller stocks found their groove again later in the third quarter, they didn't keep pace with large caps, wrote Brian Belski, the chief investment strategist at BMO, in a recent note.\\n\\nEven so, BMO remains convinced that small- and mid-cap stocks will lead their larger peers since their performance and valuations are out of sync with their underlying fundamentals.\\n\\n\\\"We continue to believe that these stocks have been unfairly punished (or ignored) given what we have viewed as a mismatch between the fundamental underpinnings and the relative performance of the group, and nothing has changed in that regard,\\\" Belski wrote.\\n\\nWhy a shift toward smaller stocks is coming\\n\\nCentral to BMO's bullish thesis for smaller stocks are the group's eye-grabbing relative performance and valuations.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nDown-cap equities are significantly oversold versus large caps after lagging for most of the last half-decade. The S&P 600 and S&P 400 are trading one standard deviation below the S&P 500, Belski noted, even though they've risen roughly 10% from their early-August lows.\\n\\nBMO Capital Markets\\n\\nHistorically, those indexes have mounted a major rebound after trailing by so much for so long.\\n\\n\\\"Relative underperformance remains quite extreme compared to historical standards, and this sort of weakness has typically been followed by swift rebounds over the past 30 years,\\\" Belski wrote. \\\"Therefore, we continue to advise investors to increase exposure to this area since we believe it is only a matter of time before the fortunes of this group take a turn for the better.\\\"\\n\\nSmall- and mid-caps are also fairly valued relative to their own histories.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nBMO analyzed a variety of valuation metrics and found that the S&P 600 is trading below its 20-year average level, while the mid-cap-oriented S&P 400 is just above it. Still, the latter looks like a bargain compared to the S&P 500, which is two standard deviations above its average.\\n\\nBMO Capital Markets\\n\\n\\\"Relative valuation for SMID is at abnormally low levels for both groups with the latest readings at roughly minus two standard deviations compared to the 20-year average,\\\" Belski wrote. \\\"These abnormal discounts more than reflect the group's earnings struggles, and [we] believe they offer compelling value for investors looking to add exposure.\\\"\\n\\nCheap valuations are far from the only catalyst for smaller stocks.\\n\\nSMID-cap earnings, which were a drag for years, have improved significantly in recent months, Belski wrote. The strategy chief is encouraged by both the cohort's forward earnings estimates and their profit outlook relative to large caps.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nBMO Capital Markets\\n\\n\\\"We believe peak pessimism is in place, making a rebound even more likely, and recent trends have begun to show some improvement,\\\" Belski wrote.\\n\\nBMO Capital Markets\\n\\nInterest rate cuts are another key tailwind, as they tend to disproportionately benefit smaller companies. SMID caps typically soar relative to large caps during monetary easing cycles, Belski wrote. He found that the S&P 600 and S&P 400 advance by an average of 12.8% and 10.7%, respectively, in the first year of cuts, versus a more modest 6.7% gain for the S&P 500.\\n\\n\\\"Average returns jump to over 20% for both groups when Fed rate cuts were able to prolong economic growth and avoid recession \\u2014 which has quickly become the consensus expectation in the current environment,\\\" Belski wrote.\\n\\n17 stocks to buy before a market reversal\\n\\nAfter a series of false starts, Belski believes smaller stocks will finally lead the market higher.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThe strategy chief listed the 17 outperform-rated stocks in BMO's US SMID-cap model portfolio.

Joining her at a panel entitled \\u201cClosing the Wealth Gap\\u201d was Sallie Krawcheck, cofounder and CEO of Ellevest.\\n\\nWomen\\u2019s wealth\\n\\nWomen have made strides as homeowners despite having to navigate the trappings of a patriarchal society. As it stands, there are more single women than single men who are homeowners, said Almodovar.\\n\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s women\\u2019s time,\\u201d she continued. \\u201cThe wake of women, when you invest in women, is way more powerful than just that individual,\\u201d Almodovar explained, pointing to the flow of wealth from women breadwinners to their families. Indeed, women are often assigned caregiving responsibilities of both their parents and children, if they have any, due to gendered norms. So, a leg up for them can represent a leg up for many.\\n\\n\\u201cNothing bad happens when women have more money,\\u201d asserted Krawcheck, adding that their wealth building leads to greater spending and a growing economy. Women uphold and fuel the economy\\u2014accounting for $20 trillion in annual consumer spending, per Harvard Business Review.\\n\\nEven so, hurdles remain. Only 30% of women report that they have the confidence to go through the mortgage process, said Almodovar, calling it a \\u201cconfidence gap.\\u201d\\n\\nHomeownership hurdles\\n\\n\\u201cThe lack of understanding for women really just amazes us,\\u201d she said. \\u201cThere\\u2019s a lot of work to be done there. And homeowners, of all genders, find themselves facing long-term costs like rising insurance costs (as impacted by climate change), taxes, and simple maintenance.\\u201d\\n\\nClaiming that women have a larger disconnect in terms of the down payment needed to buy a house than men do, she explained this issue becomes sharper with younger women. \\u201cZillennials\\u2014that\\u2019s our future homeowner, that\\u2019s the cohort, and they\\u2019re the ones that don\\u2019t understand what it takes to own a home,\\u201d she said.\\n\\nPart of the problem is what women are told they can achieve, said Krawcheck, as \\u201cthey receive negative money messages their whole lives\\u201d regarding financial planning.\\n\\nPointing out that the gender wage gap leaves many women stuck in marriages, jobs, and lives they\\u2019re unsatisfied with, Krawcheck added that homeownership is one of the only scalable, predictable markers of building wealth besides investing. While homeownership is just part of the puzzle, said Almodovar, it\\u2019s especially important for older women.\\n\\n\\u201cWhen you look at older women, in terms of their wealth, 66% comes from their home equity,\\u201d she noted. \\u201cThat seems high, but it\\u2019s not because they have more equity in their home. It\\u2019s because they don\\u2019t have other assets,\\u201d she said, adding that the average person is at 50% of their wealth from home equity but because they have other assets.\\n\\nHousing crisis\\n\\nWhile women are scaling the hill of homeownership, it\\u2019s still an incredibly difficult time to enter the market. \\u201cI\\u2019ve been doing housing for a long time. It is the first time that I could remember where both sides are talking about housing,\\u201d Almodovar said of the presidential election, noting that it demonstrates the \\u201caffordability crisis\\u201d at large.\\n\\nHitting underserved and low-income households more, the housing dilemma persists for all ages and income levels, noted Almodovar. Calling out the later average age of homeownership, continually rising prices, and Gen Zers living at home longer, Almodovar noted that as an issue \\u201chousing is not going to go away.\\u201d\\n\\nOn the other hand \\u201cit\\u2019s an exciting time,\\u201d she said, \\u201cbecause people, you know, are finally saying, \\u2018What\\u2019s up with housing?\\u2019\\u201d\"\n",

      "            \"text\": \"The beauty of Rourkela, India\\u2019s city-changing idea is in its simplicity. Giving farmers affordable access to cold storage for their crops reduces waste and increases sales.\\n\\nWhat turned that idea into an award winner in the annual Bloomberg Philanthropies Global Mayors Challenge was the ambition of its execution. Rourkela made the cold storage affordable by powering it with solar panels. It enlisted women from the community to manage the units, providing them with new skills and a new source of income. And it encouraged farmers to store excess produce there rather than selling at reduced prices to avoid spoilage in the Indian heat.\\n\\n\\u201cThis is not new technology. It is not rocket science,\\u201d said Rourkela\\u2019s commissioner Ashutosh Kulkarni. \\u201cIt is a question of ideas. I believe that ideas can move mountains.\\u201d\\n\\nTo support more innovative ideas from cities around the world, Michael R. Bloomberg, former mayor of New York City and founder of Bloomberg L.P. and Bloomberg Philanthropies, Wednesday announced the largest Mayors Challenge ever. The expanded initiative will provide 50 cities with $50,000 and an invitation to Ideas Camp so the city leaders can hone and test their ideas. The 25 cities with the best ideas will then receive $1 million and the technical support needed to enact them.\\n\\n\\u201cThis new challenge will empower cities to re-think the way they deliver essential services in ways that better meet the everyday needs of residents,\\u201d Bloomberg said in a statement from the Bloomberg CityLab 2024 meeting in Mexico City. \\u201cBloomberg Philanthropies believes in the power of cities to affect change and we\\u2019re looking forward to seeing the bold proposals that mayors put together \\u2013 and helping their cities bring them to life.\\u201d\\n\\nThe most successful of those ideas may go into the new Bloomberg Cities Ideas Exchange program, where municipal leaders share what has worked and what hasn\\u2019t, so other cities can replicate those ideas.\\n\\nPhoenix Mayor Kate Gallego says that through the Bloomberg Cities program, she has already informally learned about municipal tree-planting programs in Freetown, Sierra Leone, and how Rochester, New York, was able to get more women hired in construction \\u2013 two issues that are important in her city. And Gallego has happily shared with numerous cities how she started Phoenix\\u2019s \\u201cmobile career units\\u201d program, which travels to areas where people have challenges with transportation to inform them about job opportunities and offer interviews. That program was also a Mayors Challenge award winner.\\n\\n\\u201cCities are the beginnings of innovation for the world,\\u201d Gallego said. \\u201cWe come up with so many of the solutions for different challenges and we get real results. So many countries are failing to meet their Paris climate agreement goals, but many cities are ahead of schedule.\\u201d\\n\\nJames Anderson, who leads Bloomberg Philanthropies\\u2019 Government Innovation program, said he was excited about the expansion of the Mayors Challenge initiative, especially with its focus on reimagining core municipal services. The new initiatives are designed to get mayors to dream bigger, he added, because they get things done.\\n\\n\\u201cCities care for the well-being of the world,\\u201d Anderson said. \\u201cWe are living in an urban age. The policies and programs that mayors put in place shape the day to day well-being of citizens.\\u201d\\n\\nKulkarni, of Rourkela, said the success of his city\\u2019s cold storage program has been even more satisfying because many cities in India have already replicated and other countries are looking at starting similar programs as well.\\n\\nHe said the program has already eliminated 75% of produce waste in Rourkela and increased the revenue of small farmers in the area by 25%.\\n\\n\\u201cI joined civil service to ensure that there is some change, that there are some people will go home satisfied,\\u201d Kulkarni said. \\u201cThey will get something tangible and seeing that change gives us satisfaction.\\u201d\"\n",

      "            \"text\": \"It's 9:30 a.m., and Augustus Doricko, the mulleted 24-year-old founder of the cloud-seeding company Rainmaker, is clutching a coffee. He and his colleagues spent the prior evening hopping from one Las Vegas hot spot to the next, gorging on \\\"monstrously large\\\" steaks and smoking cigars. They tried to end the night at Bruno Mars' jazz club, The Pinky Ring, but fled due to some sort of metaphysical disturbance.\\n\\n\\\"The vibe was off,\\\" Doricko said. \\\"What you'll come to find, should we get to be friends very long, Jessica, is that the vibes are of critical import.\\\"\\n\\nThe vibes are decidedly stale at our first meeting that morning in a windowless conference room in the basement of the MGM Grand. I'd reached out to Doricko after noticing him on X, where he posts photos from his office gym, which is decorated with a \\\"Jesus died for our Zyns\\\" banner, as well as musings on startup life and water policy. He'd invited me to join him in Vegas in April, where he and his team were spreading the gospel of Rainmaker at the annual Weather Modification Association conference.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAmid the crowd of checkered shirts and receding hairlines, Doricko's staff of 20- and 30-somethings, clad in matching fleeces, look like an amateur sports team that's stumbled into the wrong room. Luckily, they have their game faces on. Rainmaker wants to revolutionize cloud seeding \\u2014 the process of firing a solution, usually silver iodide, into clouds to induce precipitation or rain that wouldn't occur naturally \\u2014 by using specialized drones, radar-based weather tracking, and numerical modeling to make the process more precise, economical, and easier to deploy.\\n\\nWhile the weather industry isn't exactly known for pumping out celebrities, Doricko has gotten as close as it gets to a household name. This year alone, he was photographed next to Bezos Earth Fund's vice chair, Lauren S\\u00e1nchez, at Miami's Aspen Ideas conference; flew to Tennessee to testify against a controversial chemtrail bill, which could limit cloud-seeding operations; and attended a Clinton Global Initiative dinner, where he and Bill, both wearing suits and sneakers, discussed how cloud seeding might supplement the country's water supply.\\n\\nDoricko's home base is El Segundo, a beachside suburb 30 minutes from Los Angeles that's known as the aerospace capital of the world. Lately, the place seems full of young tech entrepreneurs who love cigarettes, America, and throwing parties in their small-scale factories. They've built a community set apart from Silicon Valley \\u2014 one that merges techno futurism with a blue-collar aesthetic and a libertarian mindset. At its center is Doricko, who seems to know just about everyone and can be found most Sundays at Christ Church Santa Clarita where he and many of his peers do the other thing they have in common: worship God.\\n\\nDoricko, far right, hosts weekly beach bonfires in El Segundo for tech founders and their hangers-on. Jett Lara for BI\\n\\nDoricko, who resembles a baby-faced Billy Ray Cyrus, is quick to note that being Christian isn't a requirement for joining the El Segundo scene; everyone is welcome, \\\"as long as you want to build something spectacular,\\\" he said. But he also believes that if he does achieve his version of greatness \\u2014 if he manages to upend the way we interact with the weather or alleviate the water shortage that scientists say is imminent \\u2014 his success will be in service to something bigger. \\\"Any technology that moves the needle on humanity's well-being, that is something that brings us closer toward Heaven on earth,\\\" he told me while striding across the sticky carpets of the MGM Grand.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\\"I view in no small part what we're doing at Rainmaker as, cautiously and with scrutiny from others and advice from others, helping to establish the kingdom of God.\\\"\\n\\nIt won't be easy. There's a long way to go before cloud seeding becomes a viable option for solving one of humanity's many self-made crises. Beijing claimed to have used cloud seeding to ensure clear skies for the 2008 Olympics. And last year, the US government spent $2.4 million on a cloud-seeding program to revitalize the dwindling Colorado River. But the industry has seen little innovation since the 1970s, and some are skeptical that the process even works outside a laboratory, where things like wind patterns and topography are hard to control.\\n\\nI view in no small part what we're doing at Rainmaker as helping to establish the kingdom of God. Augustus Doricko\\n\\nDoricko's peers are certain he's on the cusp of something big, though. His former roommate Cameron Schiller, whose company uses 3D printing to manufacture metal parts, said Doricko's determination borders on obsession. \\\"Augustus is going to be an individual that truly changes the world \\u2014 someone that people can point to and say, 'This person did something that stands the test of time and history,'\\\" Schiller said.\\n\\n\\\"He really cares,\\\" Schiller added, \\\"and I don't think he'll stop until he sees greatness.\\\"\\n\\nEl Segundo, population 17,272, has long been a bastion of American engineering, home to aerospace and defense giants like Boeing and Raytheon. That's still true, but in the past four or so years, it's been flooded with ambitious new startups, including the autonomous-defense-systems company Picogrid, the nuclear-fission company Valar Atomics, and the pharmaceuticals-in-space company Varda Space Industries.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nDoricko and his self-described \\\"Gundo Bros\\\" are over app-based companies seeking to \\\"disrupt\\\" the way people catch cabs or order meals. They want to usher in a new era of American economic growth and stability that allows people to work in a \\\"more embodied way.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Respect to Zuck, but I certainly hope the next cohort of people that build great things do it in the real world, and build products that really make everything radically different and better,\\\" Doricko said, \\\"rather than just trying to skim a little bit more efficiency off the top of the economy.\\\"\\n\\nThe day after the conference, we fly back to California and Doricko takes me on a tour of Rainmaker's headquarters. On the walls, I spot two of El Segundo's biggest American flags (and, yes, it is a competition). The largest room, for engineering, houses Rainmaker's drones, as well as a bench press where Doricko sometimes takes interviews. In another room, desks are scattered with half-used tins of Zyn, climbing chalk, dumbbells, and a broadsword Doricko bought at an estate sale. An aerosol chemistry lab rounds out the floor, with a large, opaque bottle labeled \\\"DO NOT DRINK\\\" sitting in a corner. There's an audible buzz in the air, which I later find out is the hum of the avocado-oil processing plant across the street.\\n\\nIn some ways, El Segundo feels like a big college campus. Doricko led me through the sunny streets to Smoky Hollow Coffee Roasters, a local staple filled with people typing away on their keyboards. We sat outside on a bench, and he told me how proud he was of his neighbors. They \\\"are trying to enact a vision for the industry they're in, the country that we're in, the future of humanity \\u2014 that requires radical execution,\\\" he said. At the same time, they're \\\"silly, can go booze, can go burn a bunch of stuff at the beach.\\\"\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nEl Segundo's founders \\\"are trying to enact a vision that requires radical execution,\\\" Doricko said. At the same time, they're \\\"silly, can go booze, can go burn a bunch of stuff at the beach.\\\" Jett Lara for BI\\n\\nThe burning happens every Friday around 8 p.m. at a bonfire on El Segundo Beach. (Doricko once posted an invite on X urging his followers to come watch \\\"the finest Swedish assemblies set ablaze\\\" and tagging Ikea.) Founders go, but so do young people from states as far away as North Carolina or Texas. They're hoping to shake some hands, meet some people, and land a job in the Gundo by the time Monday rolls around, Doricko said.\\n\\nRelated stories\\n\\nSeveral hours after our coffee, Doricko and I arrived at that week's bonfire party in his white Chevrolet pickup. The crowd, mostly white men and some women, chatter about tech, work, and Elon Musk, who's only ever referred to by his first name. At the fire's edge, I strike up a conversation with Isaiah Taylor, the 25-year-old founder of Valar Atomics and a friend of Doricko's. \\\"I can look around right now and see a lot of people that sleep in the office,\\\" Taylor said. \\\"It might be making it rain more, making the Earth habitable, might be making energy cheaper \\u2014 we're not apologetic about wanting to build extremely hard things for our community and country. We all love America.\\\"\\n\\nFor Taylor, like Doricko, love of country is closely linked to love of God. Taylor periodically hosts community Bible study and prayer sessions and invites his fellow founders to join. Not all of them believe in God, but many do. And Doricko has a theory why: \\\"This is a pretty rebellious group of people,\\\" he said. \\\"And if the zeitgeist is nihilistically secular, then the rebellious stance is to be Christian.\\\"\\n\\nAlmost prophetically, much of Doricko's childhood took place in the water. He grew up in Stamford, Connecticut, and learned to sail at the Stamford Yacht Club, where his parents were members until they separated in 2007.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nHe considers those years, which he often spent soaked through and freezing \\u2014 once to the point of hypothermia \\u2014 to be formative. His sailing coach, Rob Coutts, who won a world championship title for New Zealand, was \\\"tough as nails,\\\" Doricko said. \\\"Kids would be crying, there'd be howling wind, and he'd use very choice words to tell them to get back in the boat. Most kids didn't like him, but I loved him.\\\"\\n\\nIf the zeitgeist is nihilistically secular, then the rebellious stance is to be Christian. Augustus Doricko\\n\\nIn high school, Doricko lived with his mom and younger sister. He stayed busy with the debate team, more sailing, and countless hours playing the video game \\\"Spore,\\\" which he used to turn barren planets into diverse and sophisticated ecosystems. He'd hoped to become an astronaut, but his plans were scuppered when a swim in a Costa Rican bog ruptured his right auditory nerve, leaving him deaf in one ear. Instead, he went to the University of California, Berkeley, as a physics major.\\n\\nBy the end of his first year, he was disillusioned, frustrated at the prospect of spending decades doing research to move the scientific needle forward even a millimeter. He started to get restless. Then, Doricko found God.\\n\\nIt began because his love of absurdist philosophers \\u2014 who posit that everything in life is random and irrational \\u2014 started to drive him mad. His classmates seemed comfortable with the idea that their lives were of no moral consequence, but Doricko, who hadn't grown up religious, ironically found the idea \\\"insufferable.\\\" He started to think that if life was truly meaningless, there was no reason not to pursue a path of \\\"reckless hedonism.\\\" Things came to a head one day in January 2020, when he walked past several homeless people on the streets of Berkeley. \\\"I was starting to think, 'Well, it's entirely possible to end up like them, and there's no reason not to,'\\\" he said.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThat moment sent him on a frantic search for meaning; he spoke to two nondenominational pastors, a Catholic priest, a Sunni imam, and two rabbis. He seriously considered converting to Judaism, but eventually, inspired by historical accounts of Jesus of Nazareth, he settled on Christianity. \\\"Believing that something, someone, God, loved me no matter my faults \\u2014 desired that I improve upon my faults, but loved me in spite of them \\u2014 that was earth-shaking,\\\" Doricko told me.\\n\\nStill, some of his views put him at odds with the average Gen Zer. \\\"I have and I love plenty of friends that are gay or that are very pro-choice, and I'll continue to,\\\" Doricko said. But \\\"I don't know if those are the things that our Lord wants for us.\\\"\\n\\nIn October 2020, Doricko moved to Fort Worth, Texas, to attend Berkeley remotely. He dove into Bible study while simultaneously crafting his powerlifting, milk-drinking, gym-bro persona. At Berkeley, he'd been clean-cut and preppy \\u2014 a style he saw as a \\\"rebellion\\\" against omnipresent athleisure. But these days he's more likely to sport shearling-lined denim jackets, Jesus-themed T-shirts, and sweats. \\\"My aesthetic preferences are just trying to push the needle on what we can look like,\\\" he explained. \\\"Because if we stay the same, we stay the same, and the current condition is not good.\\\"\\n\\nRainmaker's office is a reclaimed warehouse, which includes a gym where Doricko sometimes takes interviews. Jett Lara for BI\\n\\nDoricko started weight training with the entrepreneur Jason Flynt, one of the biggest water-well drillers in Texas. As they worked out together, Doricko learned about Flynt's business, and by November 2020, Flynt offered him a contracted project: writing code to help digitize elements of the well-pumping process. The project went so well that a year later, Doricko and Flynt launched Terra Seco, a company that automated regulatory compliance and monitoring for groundwater wells.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nDoricko left Berkeley in 2022, just two months shy of graduating, to focus on Terra Seco full time. But even then, he knew that the company's efforts weren't enough to solve the issue of water scarcity. He spent the better part of a year researching what he saw as the real solution: conjuring water out of thin air.\\n\\nDuring that time, he read the book \\\"Paper Belt on Fire,\\\" by the former Thiel Foundation executive Michael Gibson, which lists cloud seeding as one of the 100 technologies that will shape the future. That led Doricko to the 2023 Weather Modification Association conference, where he watched the scientist Sarah Tessendorf's presentation on the SNOWIE project: the first-ever quantitative study proving that cloud seeding worked. Doricko sold off his shares in Terra Seco and messaged Gibson on X. \\\"I was like, 'Michael, Michael, Michael. I figured it out. I know how we can make cloud seeding real,'\\\" he said. \\\"Then I read more about it, and I was like: 'Oh, this is way more complicated.'\\\"\\n\\nGibson \\u2014 whose venture-capital firm, 1517 Fund, backs \\\"college dropouts and sci-fi scientists\\\" \\u2014 was impressed by Doricko's industry knowledge, but he was truly won over by his charisma. \\\"We meet a lot of engineers who can build a great many things, but they're terrible at working with people,\\\" Gibson said. \\\"Augustus both had the engineering and the smarts to actually run this company.\\\" In April 2023, Gibson's fund invested $100,000 in Rainmaker. The next year, it forked over another half-million dollars.\\n\\nThat same year, Doricko also landed a Thiel fellowship, bestowed upon tech's brightest college dropouts, which comes with $100,000 and a two-year networking and mentorship program. Like Peter Thiel himself, Doricko is happy to talk about how school is a waste of time. \\\"There's so much opportunity out in the world. Why would I spend my time studying for a test?\\\" he said. \\\"I'm not going to go through the indignity of accepting a credential from somebody to prove that I'm a capable member of the workforce.\\\"\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nWhen asked how he first learned to code, Doricko laughed. \\\"Uh, classes,\\\" he said. \\\"Classes at university.\\\"\\n\\nWith Rainmaker, Doricko has taken on a rather complex problem. Numerous studies before the SNOWIE project produced inconclusive results about cloud seeding's efficacy, and some scientists worry that it may not work at all or, at the very least, may be useless against extreme weather events like droughts.\\n\\nRelated stories\\n\\nKatja Friedrich, an atmospheric scientist, says many existing cloud-seeding programs rely on measurements taken by small, twin-engine airplanes to determine when and where to seed clouds. These same planes then fire the flares containing the iodide solution. Both processes are easily thrown off by variables like wind speed and rapidly changing temperatures.\\n\\nRainmaker wants to do away with the planes altogether and replace them with drones, which would be much cheaper. (Plane-based cloud-seeding operations typically cost thousands of dollars an hour, but Doricko claims Rainmaker's cost about $20 an hour for the same level of coverage, in part because the drones rely on electricity instead of fuel.)\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nRainmaker has cycled through dozens of drone models as they seek to reimagine cloud seeding. Jett Lara for BI\\n\\nBut Friedrich warns that this isn't a perfect solution, pointing to obstacles like FAA regulations, drone battery life, and collecting accurate measurements from the drones, which can't carry as much monitoring equipment. Friedrich isn't the only one who's skeptical. While Jonathan Jennings, who oversees Utah's cloud-seeding program and serves as president of the Weather Modification Association, is a Doricko fan in general, he said that \\\"there's always going to be a human element that I want to see in the field. So I'm a little resistant to drones in most cases.\\\"\\n\\nDoricko isn't deterred. For one thing, he claims that the industry-wide aversion to drones is, in part, financially motivated because business owners don't want to spend money to update their technology. \\\"There is momentum and vested interest in what are potentially less efficient modes of delivery,\\\" he said. Plus, he has a planet to save. Just look at the dwindling levels of water in the Colorado River Delta; the enormous drops in drawdowns from Lake Mead, Las Vegas' primary water source; and housing development bans in Phoenix, which no longer has enough water to support new inhabitants. \\\"I would certainly prefer a world where we at least can avert catastrophe,\\\" Doricko said, \\\"to a world where we just have a slow, whimpering death and march toward said catastrophe.\\\"\\n\\nDoricko currently has a team of 23 people, including Kaitlyn Suski, an aerosol scientist who used to work at Juul. Suski is developing an alternative nucleation agent to silver iodide that Rainmaker eventually hopes to patent. (Exposure to large amounts of silver iodide can cause symptoms like vomiting and respiratory issues, and while cloud seeding uses so little that the likelihood of side effects is thought to be minuscule, Doricko wants to get ahead of the problem.)\\n\\nRainmaker employees' desks are scattered with tins of Zyn, climbing chalk, and dumbbells. Jett Lara for BI\\n\\nOther Rainmaker employees are creating anti-icing systems that will allow drones to fly as close as possible to clouds filled with supercooled liquid, which provide the best possible conditions for cloud seeding. They're also honing their radar and lidar processing to monitor how much rain is produced by each cloud-seeding attempt. In theory, all of this will make cloud seeding easier, more accessible, and more commercially viable.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nOn a sunny Saturday, I accompany Doricko and Jackson Schultz, the head of engineering, to a 6,000-acre farm about an hour south of Fresno where the company tests its drones. They're cycling through different models, sussing out which supplier can provide one ideal for flying through clouds. Today's choice, named Elijah, is a robust model with a 6-foot wingspan.\\n\\nOut in the field, along with the breeze and the birdsong, you can hear the occasional whirring of Elijah's engine as it struggles to take off. The drone's tiny wheels \\u2014 a hallmark of this particular model \\u2014 are getting tripped up by the farm's rocky terrain, preventing it from gaining enough speed for flight.\\n\\nDoricko and Schultz drive around for a while looking for a new launch site: someplace where the ground is smoother. Eventually, though, they run out of time. Schultz has to go to San Jose to pick up his new car, a vintage green Corvette.\\n\\nThe next day, we head to church. We're joined by Isaiah Taylor, the Valar Atomics founder, and a few others from Friday night's bonfire. After the service, everyone spills out onto the grass, grabbing coffees from a folding table and chattering under a cloudless sky.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nEventually, Taylor and Doricko want to build their own church in El Segundo: a dedicated house of worship for the young tech elite. They want to strengthen the bonds of their already close-knit community \\u2014 give their peers the gift they've discovered for themselves. \\\"If I can help, through creating a church, share the grace of God with other people, that would be one of the biggest blessings I'll have ever undertaken,\\\" Doricko said.\\n\\nThat night, Doricko will fly to Dubai to speak to UAE government officials about its national cloud-seeding program, which some scientists think contributed to flash floods that killed four people. Doricko considers himself a bit of a fanboy of Dubai's work. The fact that the city is \\\"now bringing more water to the desert than their ancestors ever could have prayed for is super exciting,\\\" he said.\\n\\nOne of Doricko's goals is to build a church in El Segundo to \\\"share the grace of God with other people.\\\" Jett Lara for BI\\n\\nDoricko's plans Stateside are equally grand. He wants to extend the Great Plains from the Midwest through West Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada, and California, blanketing the Western states in lush, arable land capable of supporting communities. \\\"We have this planet that we can turn into a garden,\\\" he says. In his eyes, protecting that planet \\u2014 and preventing climate disaster \\u2014 is God's will. \\\"Mankind was made to take care of and tend to the garden and make it grow well and flourish,\\\" he said. \\\"That extends to now, right? It's in our nature to take dominion and be generative with it.\\\"\\n\\nUltimately, Doricko hopes to turn El Segundo into something like Amsterdam during the Enlightenment, or Milan during the Renaissance. But that all depends on whether companies like Rainmaker have staying power. \\\"The reputation of the Gundo will very much live or die by the success of these startups,\\\" Gibson, the early Rainmaker investor, said. If they fail, \\\"all this countercultural stuff will have faded out, because the companies just didn't make it.\\\"\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nGibson believes that Doricko has enough \\\"gusto\\\" and \\\"love of the fight\\\" to make it happen. But his faith isn't blind.\\n\\nDoricko \\\"has said sometimes, 'I think God is on our side,'\\\" Gibson said. \\\"And I'll say: 'Yeah, but the Lord works in mysterious ways.'\\\"\"\n",

However, a bold move by Saudi Arabia could jeopardize that strategy.\\n\\nSaudi Arabia is reportedly planning to abandon its unofficial price target of $100 per barrel for crude oil in a bid to grab market share by upping supply, according to a Financial Times report in September.\\n\\nA potential increase in supply set the price of OPEC+ oil, which represents 60% of oil traded globally, tumbling in the wake of the news, suggesting that the post-COVID era of high-priced fossil fuels could be coming to an end.\\n\\nThe country is planning to challenge the U.S. crude industry, where oil extraction is more expensive, while implicitly confirming it is difficult to charge more than $100 a barrel for crude. A Saudi minister warned in October that prices could fall as low as $50 a barrel.\\n\\nThe biggest victim, however, could very well be Russia\\u2019s war machine.\\n\\n\\u201cFor Russia, this is the worst of both worlds,\\u201d Luke Cooper, a research fellow at the London School of Economics, wrote for the IPS journal.\\n\\n\\u201cUnlike the United States, it has an oil-dependent economy, which benefits from the cartel power of OPEC+. Yet, unlike Saudi Arabia, its oil is not cheap to extract, making it poorly equipped to deal with low-price conditions.\\n\\n\\u201cThis drives a short-term escalatory logic for Russia\\u2019s war on Ukraine, requiring rapid battlefield successes prior to the emergence of low-price oil market conditions.\\u201d\\n\\nCooper pointed out that because Saudi Arabia\\u2019s and Iran\\u2019s oil wells are closer to the surface, they are cheaper to extract. Russia, on the other hand, has to spend more on production costs to extract its deep oil wells, reducing its margins.\\n\\nRussia\\u2019s flagging war machine\\n\\nRussia was hit with sanctions from the West in the wake of its February 2022 invasion of Ukraine. These measures have proved more harmful to the countries leveling the sanctions than to Russia itself.\\n\\nGermany, which long relied on cheap Russian fuel imports, has faced a drawn-out recession in its production sector, while its economy as a whole is expected to shrink for the second year in a row in 2024.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Russia\\u2019s economy grew 3.6% in 2023 and expanded at an annualized rate of 5.4% in the first quarter of 2024. However, the country has been forced to be a price taker in available markets, including China, as a result.\\n\\nStefan Hedlund, director of research at the Centre for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Uppsala University, thinks Russia\\u2019s growth figures are a mirage clouded by Russia\\u2019s wartime spending, which has artificially inflated GDP.\\n\\n\\u201cThe simplest explanation is the right one: Russia\\u2019s GDP growth stems from a massive boost in spending on defense,\\u201d Hedlund wrote in Geopolitical Intelligence Services.\\n\\n\\u201cLarge amounts of money are being funneled to contracting Russian soldiers, many of whom will be killed in Ukraine, and to the production of military hardware, much of which will be destroyed on the battlefield. Neither of these outputs can be justified in the long term.\\u201d\\n\\nWriting for Project Syndicate, economist and author Anders \\u00c5slund warned that Russia may need to conclude its war in Ukraine by the end of 2025 to prevent economic catastrophe.\\n\\nRussia\\u2019s lucrative weapons exports have collapsed amid more demand from its own troops, while the country is also dealing with \\u201chidden inflation\\u201d and constraints to its budget deficit, \\u00c5slund wrote.\\n\\nThere are a number of factors that will determine whether Russia\\u2019s ability to continue selling oil at the price needed to sustain its war machine, LSE\\u2019s Cooper says.\\n\\nThat includes the extent of the green transition, how aggressively Saudi Arabia increases its oil exports, and whether Israel and Iran can step away from the brink of all-out war in the Middle East.\\n\\n\\u201cIf these factors evolve in such a way as to produce an oil price collapse that is equivalent in scale to 2014\\u20132016, the Russian regime may encounter difficulties financing its war economy,\\u201d said Cooper.\"\n",

He\\u2019s also got kidneys, intestines, and a heart\\u2014all made of felt\\u2014because he\\u2019s designed to be dissected.\\n\\nNow, this might sound like a bizarre genetic engineering project, but the reality is much more wholesome: Froggie is for kids, the star of the Froggie Dissection Lab made by KiwiCo, a STEM-based toy and activity brand. And Froggie isn\\u2019t an anomaly; he\\u2019s a prime example of what KiwiCo does. The company frequently takes educational subjects and distills them down to their most playful essence, making angler fish or science experiments (like frog dissections) into toys that kids want to be near.\\n\\n\\u201cIn part, I was personally motivated to start [KiwiCo] when my two older kids were almost three and five,\\u201d said Sandra Oh Lin, KiwiCo CEO and founder. \\u201cI really wanted them to have these hands-on experiences. It was important to me that they felt they had the agency to create\\u2026The idea of having kids who are empowered to feel they can innovate, I think, is really important. How cool is it that you know you\\u2019re able to create something out of seemingly nothing?\\u201d\\n\\nThat\\u2019s what Lin wants kids to feel when they succeed in building the Light-Up Haunted House or the Walking Robot. But that\\u2019s also what Lin has done with KiwiCo, building something out of nothing, weathering a deluge of investor rejections and the direct-to-consumer downturn of recent years. The company has been historically sparse in the metrics it discloses, until now: Since its 2011 founding, KiwiCo has generated more than $1 billion in revenue, Fortune has exclusively learned. In that time, the company has shipped more than 50 million crates to more than 40 countries, and throughout its lifespan has designed north of 1,500 products and activities. (The company declined to disclose annual revenue.)\\n\\nAs many consumer-focused startups have struggled, KiwiCo has generated an operating profit for seven years. The company has confirmed to Fortune that it is projected to see double-digit revenue growth in 2025. KiwiCo has also raised only $10 million in venture backing (including from First Round Capital and Forerunner Ventures), and the last round the company raised was a Series A in 2015.\\n\\n\\u201cWe\\u2019ve been fortunate that we\\u2019ve been able to fund our own growth [for years],\\u201d said Lin.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s an impressive trajectory for a story that started with Lin\\u2014a mom with credentials, but a mom nonetheless\\u2014feeling out of place.\\n\\n\\u201cI was the only mini-van in the parking lot on Sand Hill,\\u201d she told Fortune. \\u201cI was able to talk to and build credibility because I had worked at PayPal and at eBay, I\\u2019d gone to business school\\u2026But I think it was a real ding that I worked on something that was for kids. It\\u2019s an interesting part of the story that I\\u2019ve kind of tucked away.\\u201d\\n\\nOMERS Ventures senior managing partner (and KiwiCo board member, who invested back when he was at Comcast Ventures) Michael Yang first met Lin when the company was still \\u201ca minivan in her garage with supplies.\\u201d He was struck by how Lin was tapping into something slightly rebellious.\\n\\n\\u201cYou could see she was clearly the cool mom on the block when she created her own arts and crafts pseudo-crates for neighborhood kids,\\u201d said Yang. \\u201cI just thought, \\u2018Man, this is a throwback to a different era.\\u2019 It was such counter-programming. This was the early 2010s, when the iPad was on the rise and people were shoving iPads in front of their kids, saying \\u2018download a game, entertain yourself.\\u2019 So this was a little bit of pushback on some of that movement.\\u201d\\n\\nKiwiCo both is and isn\\u2019t a venture story, I think. Though VC money got KiwiCo started, it hasn\\u2019t fueled the company for almost a decade.\\n\\n\\u201cIt got super tough,\\u201d said Yang. \\u201cShe never raised more than a seed and Series A, and had to make it her own\\u2026This is, by far, my longest-standing board and, yes, goes to show that private companies are staying private longer, for sure. But I think it\\u2019s also a story of personal fortitude, resilience, doggedness to the vision\\u2014and, of course, execution on that vision.\\u201d\\n\\n2024 has been a busy year for KiwiCo. The company recently unveiled a new take on its central subscription model, KiwiCo Clubs, which features a curated progression of activities and a soon-to-be-launched digital platform. KiwiCo has also been growing its education business, which has served almost 10,000 organizations, and this year established publishing division KiwiCo Press as its own vertical, breaking it off from its previous subscription fold-in. (The publishing unit has sold more than five million books, KiwiCo says.)\\n\\nThe company may have started as direct-to-consumer, but it decidedly isn\\u2019t anymore\\u2014in July, KiwiCo expanded into brick-and-mortar retail in Target and Barnes & Noble. Is there anything we can learn about DTC from KiwiCo? Yang says yes: As the traditional DTC playbook becomes more difficult and expensive, DTC companies now have to get more creative and put in more hard work to attract and retain customers in a more competitive and pricey landscape. But there are also new ideas and models emerging that Yang thinks KiwiCo could be primed to capitalize on down the line.\\n\\n\\u201cJust think of all the rich IP that speaks to this demographic of kids, and if you have crates and projects that are in line with that,\\u201d he said. \\u201cThen, you start looking at what Mattel did with Barbie, what Hasbro did with Transformers, and so on.\\u201d\\n\\nThere\\u2019s one more obvious question: How does KiwiCo keep making so many clever toys at scale? I\\u2019ve been to their office, and it\\u2019s not all that big. But it is a place centered on play: When I visited, I saw dozens of kids play-testing\\u2014hanging out in classroom-like spaces, spinning tops and playing with foam archery sets. Lin and I stood, as she watched for delight. And it\\u2019s not always the things you expect. Nolan, who\\u2019s 12 and from Orange County, told me (with his parents\\u2019 permission) via email: \\u201cMy favorite project is the safe I built\\u2014I still use it to store my stuff!\\u201d\\n\\nI asked Froggie\\u2019s designer, senior manager of product strategy Rebekah Winegarner, about the design process and she told me about fast timelines frequently limited by the challenges of building a physical product. (\\u201cYou can\\u2019t make paint dry faster, but we\\u2019re working on it,\\u201d she laughed.) But it seems like one of the key rules is that if you\\u2019re not delighted, then the kids won\\u2019t be either.\\n\\n\\u201cIf it\\u2019s something worth doing well, it\\u2019s always going to be kind of hard and unexpected,\\u201d said Winegarner. \\u201cBut it\\u2019s always worth putting your heart and soul into.\\u201d\\n\\nI was breathlessly charmed by Froggie when I first saw him. I\\u2019ve been trying to figure out why, and this is the closest I\\u2019ve come to an answer: It takes time and care to turn something traditionally considered educational and gross into something lovable. It takes a special person to look at something weird, gruesome, or boring and to see something playful. It\\u2019s a world view where cuteness is a matter of perspective, even frog dissections can be sweet, and everything that kids touch deserves to be awesome, for them and for us.\\n\\n\\u201cWe have a very high-quality bar that includes the delight piece,\\u201d said Lin. \\u201cWe call it \\u2018whoa, awesome.\\u2019 That\\u2019s our brand attribute.\\u201d\\n\\nAnd Froggie did make me say, \\u201cwhoa, awesome.\\u201d Froggie\\u2019s been through a lot of iterations since he first was designed in 2019. His body size and arm thickness have changed, his closures are now buttons, and his intestinal pom-poms have been adjusted. Save for the innard pom-poms, you could say the same about KiwiCo over the last 13 years.\\n\\nBut today, both are in Target. And I like to imagine that in a Target somewhere right now, there\\u2019s a kid falling in love with Froggie\\u2019s eyes, who will take the time to gently open him up, and look inside.\\n\\nICYMI\\u2026Khosla Ventures has reportedly raised $405 million through an SPV for OpenAI.\\n\\nHello from Laguna Niguel\\u2026Running KiwiCo\\u2019s story today felt right, because Fortune\\u2019s Most Powerful Women Summit kicks off today at the Ritz-Carlton in Laguna Niguel.

The companies announced this September that they were expanding operations into Atlanta and Austin in 2025. Waymo and Uber were once entangled in a lawsuit over self-driving technology but reached a $245 million settlement in 2018.\\n\\nThe expansion comes as Waymo and Tesla compete to lead the autonomous vehicle industry.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nUber announced a partnership with Waymo in 2023. PATRICK T. FALLON/AFP via Getty Images\\n\\nDuring the episode, Khosrowshahi responded to a question asking if he considered Tesla a competitor following the company's \\\"We, Robot\\\" event this month. At the event, Musk gave the public their first glimpse of Tesla's robotaxi \\u2014 dubbed Cybercab. It left former Waymo CEO John Krafcik and some Wall Street analysts unimpressed despite the hype.\\n\\nMusk said Cybercabs would be in production before 2027.\\n\\n\\\"Well, they certainly could be, right? If they develop their own AV vehicle and they decide to go direct only through the Tesla app, they would be a competitor,\\\" Khosrowshahi said. \\\"If they decide to work with us, then we would be a partner as well.\\\"\\n\\nKhosrowshahi then called Musk's vision \\\"pretty compelling.\\\"\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\\"You might have these cyber shepherds or these owners of these fleets,\\\" he said. \\\"Those owners, if they want to have maximum earnings on those fleets, will want to put those fleets on Uber. But at this point, it's unknown what his intentions are.\\\"\\n\\nElon Musk showed off Tesla's Cybercab during the \\\"We, Robot\\\" event in October. Tesla\\n\\nAlthough Uber has positioned itself with Waymo, Khosrowshahi said he is open to partnering with Tesla during an interview with the Financial Times earlier this month.\\n\\nRelated stories\\n\\n\\\"We'd love to have it on the platform, but if not, I don't think this is going to be a winner-take-all marketplace. We believe in the spirit of partnership; we'll see what Tesla does,\\\" he said.\\n\\nOn the Hard Fork podcast, Khosrowshahi championed Waymo, saying he believed Waymo could best Tesla.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\\"I think Elon eventually will get to a viable scale, but for the next five years, I bet on Waymo, and we are betting on Waymo,\\\" he said.\\n\\nThe sentiment is somewhat at odds with what Andrej Karpathy, a founding team member of OpenAI and former senior director of AI at Tesla, said on an episode of the \\\"No Priors: Artificial Intelligence\\\" podcast in September. Karpathy said he believed Tesla had an advantage because Waymo has a hardware problem, whereas Musk's company has a software problem.\\n\\nHe said the latter is easier to solve, adding that Tesla may pull ahead about a decade later.\\n\\nKhosrowshahi spoke about Waymo's hardware during the Hard Fork podcast, saying, \\\"I think that hardware costs scale down over a period of time. So, sure, Waymo has a hardware problem, but they can solve it.\\\"\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nUber originally tried to walk the autonomous vehicle path alone, creating a self-driving car unit called Advanced Technologies Group. However, the company faced a series of setbacks \\u2014 including a deadly crash in 2018 \\u2014 that led it to sell the unit to the self-driving car startup Aurora in 2020.\\n\\nRepresentatives for Uber did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\"\n",

      "            \"text\": \"No one's going to sound an alarm, blast out a text message, or shoot you an email about it, but the US economy is undergoing a historic shift. We are leaving one long period of expansion \\u2014 what economists refer to as a \\\"supercycle\\\" \\u2014 and entering a very different one.\\n\\nOver the past 15 years, the economy has been characterized by weak demand and low interest rates \\u2014 a decade-and-a-half hangover from the Great Recession. Now, experts tell me, that is coming to an end. The world has changed, and we are entering an era of higher growth, creeping inflation, and geopolitical instability that will reroute the flow of money around the world. A new era has arrived, but it's going to be bumpy.\\n\\nThe good news is that this new era looks as if it will be unencumbered by some of the problems that put a ceiling on growth during the previous era. The most salient feature of the old period, economists say, was the risk of deflation \\u2014 the possibility that a lack of demand would cause wages and prices to spiral downward, a trap that is extremely difficult to escape. In an effort to avoid that fate, policymakers in Washington pushed interest rates down to zero and encouraged all kinds of risky behavior among investors, businesses, and everyday consumers. Investors trying to reach their benchmarks \\\"had to creep out on the risk spectrum,\\\" Josh Hirt, a senior economist at Vanguard, tells me. \\\"Supercheap debt,\\\" he says, made it easy for businesses to \\\"overexpand and overhire.\\\"\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThe pro-risk environment had some earth-shifting consequences. Silicon Valley put the internet on our phones, China blew a massive bubble in its property market, and the world started investing in renewable energy. But low interest rates did little to boost demand, and the economy consistently grew slower than it did before the crash, never notching above 3% GDP growth. It was only after the massive government stimulus, spurred by the pandemic, that the economy reached escape velocity, pushing up wages and starting to grow at a healthy clip.\\n\\nNow, economists say, we're entering a supercycle that will be characterized by three sweeping forces. First, higher interest rates will reward savers, making it more expensive to take risks. Second, geopolitical and economic volatility will generate inflationary effects, reintroducing the specter of soaring prices. And third, industrial planning will be increasingly influenced by national-security concerns, altering supply chains across industries. How low interest rates wind up settling will establish a new gravitational pull in global markets, recalibrating the forces that determine where the economy is most likely to grow \\u2014 and where investment is most likely to flow.\\n\\nThe new supercycle \\\"puts the economy in a completely new era,\\\" says Silas Myers, the CEO of Mar Vista Investments, which oversees $4 billion in assets. He warns that an entire generation of investors, lenders, and entrepreneurs have failed to embrace the \\\"profound impact\\\" that the new economic era will have on their businesses.\\n\\n\\\"We were in a time that was less demanding and more forgiving,\\\" Myers says. \\\"But that time is ending.\\\"\\n\\nRelated stories\\n\\nOne of the clearest signs that a new economic supercycle has arrived is when the financial rules go topsy-turvy. The previous supercycle was ushered in when the Federal Reserve, in response to the destruction caused by the financial crisis, cut its benchmark interest rate to 0% \\u2014 the first time the central bank went all the way to the bottom.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThe structural shift sent shockwaves throughout the world. Yields on Treasury bonds tanked, meaning investors had to start taking some serious risks if they wanted to make money. This new adventurism pushed stocks higher and higher. Capital went flying into China and other emerging markets in record amounts \\u2014 some $1 trillion in 2010 alone. Venture capitalists sank billions into companies like Juicero and WeWork that had no viable plan to turn a profit. And with interest rates so low, companies could suddenly load up on debt: From 2007 to 2017, global nonfinancial corporate debt doubled, to $66 trillion. Until the pandemic hit, inflation and wage growth both remained below 3.9%. The world had changed.\\n\\nSomething has scrambled the natural interactions of the marketplace. It's as if you put your hand over a hot stove and your fingers turned ice cold.\\n\\nNow, with the arrival of a new supercycle, money managers are once again being forced to adapt to a changing set of economic realities. Normally, when the Fed hikes interest rates rapidly, the stock market tanks. But that's no longer true. From 2022 to 2024, as the benchmark federal funds rate shot up to 5.5% from 0.5%, the Nasdaq 100 and the S&P 500 soared by 23% and 22%. Higher interest rates also failed to spur widespread layoffs or crater the economy. Unemployment has stayed below 4.3%, and GDP growth has remained solid, defying fears of a recession. In short, something has scrambled the natural interactions of the marketplace. It's as if you put your hand over a hot stove and your fingers turned ice cold.\\n\\nOne explanation for the economy's topsy-turvy behavior is a change in what economists call the neutral interest rate \\u2014 the optimal point for encouraging growth without triggering inflation. After the financial crisis in 2008, the economy was so weak that the neutral rate went to zero to encourage money to flow more freely. But now the market's weird nature may be signaling that the neutral rate has risen above the Fed's ideal target of 2%. That would explain why the Fed's higher rates are no longer putting the brakes on growth. Fueled by the post-pandemic government stimulus, the economy's baseline has shifted. Over at Vanguard, Hirt and his colleagues predict that the neutral rate will stay higher for the foreseeable future, eventually settling at about 3.5%.\\n\\n\\\"Even if we do dip below 3.5%, the Fed will be anchored at that higher rate,\\\" Hirt says. \\\"If the economy were to experience weakness and we have to cut rates, we still don't think that means taking rates back to zero.\\\"\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nUnless you're a boomer, you've probably never experienced a world with this high a neutral rate. It changes the nature of risk, which changes what people decide to do with money on micro and macro levels. If you can get a decent return parking your money in ultrasafe government debt, why risk investing it in a startup or stomach the stock market's volatility? This isn't to say no one will be out here taking risks with their cash \\u2014 it will just flow in different directions. That's because consumers are in a better place now than they were in the era that emerged after the Great Recession.\\n\\nThe economy is \\\"an extraordinarily diverse and dynamic animal,\\\" Joe Quinlan, the chief market strategist at Bank of America, assured clients in a recent note. It's \\\"a $28 trillion hydra-headed behemoth that beats to the tune of many different sectors.\\\" As the Fed's higher rates were putting a strain on rate-sensitive sectors like housing \\u2014 which makes up 16% of the economy \\u2014 Big Tech and travel-starved households were spending money fast and loose. The experience showed that overall consumption can continue to rise even when significant swaths of the economy are struggling.\\n\\nRelated stories\\n\\nSo what can we expect from the new economic supercycle? Like every cycle, it will have its upsides and downsides. Rising interest rates will make loans more expensive, forcing businesses to make more-thoughtful decisions about debt. But they'll also boost savings accounts and interest income. In addition, a faster-growing economy will tighten the labor market, empowering workers to continue to fight for a larger slice of the pie. Since 2019, the bottom 10% of earners have seen a wage increase of 13%.\\n\\nShifting away from the \\\"grow at all costs\\\" mindset of the previous supercycle has also incentivized governments \\u2014 especially in the developed world \\u2014 to do more to police markets and protect consumers. Whether it's capping the price of drugs or enforcing antitrust rules more aggressively, polls suggest Americans want to see more limits on corporate power and more regulation to safeguard citizens. For the first time in years, the Federal Trade Commission has begun going after pharmaceutical middlemen, opposing mergers between grocery giants, and taking big swings at Big Tech.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThe new supercycle will also have profound consequences worldwide, upending how and where money is most likely to flow. In China, the debt bubble that formed in the property sector during the previous cycle is sucking cash away from businesses and households, undermining China's bid to become the world's leading economic superpower. And with Europe growing more slowly than the US, foreign investors are steering more of their money to America. In the second quarter of this year, foreign investors owned $8.2 trillion worth of US Treasury bonds, up by 7.3% from a year earlier. Foreign investment is also soaring in US corporate bonds (up by 9.8%) and US equities (up by 23%). Quinlan says he expects the US economy to continue outperforming the rest of the world, given the fiscal and demographic challenges facing the European Union, Japan, and China. In an era of increasing instability, when former sources of growth are flailing, the United States is widely viewed as the safest place to find returns.\\n\\n\\\"Not lost on investors is the fact that the US economy remains among the most competitive, innovative, and resilient in the world,\\\" Quinlan wrote in a recent note to investors. \\\"Aerospace or agriculture, energy or entertainment, transportation or technology, goods or services \\u2014 pick any sector or activity, and there's a good chance the US leads the rest of the world. All of this has helped fuel demand among foreign investors for US securities of all stripes.\\\"\\n\\nAs the economy evolves, those who adapt will be most likely to survive.\\n\\nAmerica's economic diversification is also expected to give it a leg up in one of the most volatile features of the new era: trade conflict. The US and China are already battling for control over critical industries like semiconductors, batteries, and electric cars \\u2014 and the tit for tat will be especially costly for less diversified economies. Germany's dependence on manufacturing, for example, places its most essential industries on a collision course with China's ambitions. And while the United States is well positioned to weather the storm, that doesn't mean it won't be rough. The world has never faced a challenge like the skyrocketing flow of exports from China up and down the value chain. It's a dynamic that threatens to imbalance international trade by flooding the market with cheap goods of all kinds. China Shock 2.0 \\\"will not go down easily,\\\" Quinlan tells me.\\n\\nFor over a decade we have become accustomed to the economy working a certain way \\u2014 if this, then that. As a new supercycle emerges, investors, businesses, and governments that structured themselves around the old model may experience acute shocks. To succeed in this unfamiliar new world, they'll have to adjust their expectations and find ways to harness the supercycle's opportunities. It's the economic equivalent of natural selection: As the economy evolves, those who adapt will be most likely to survive. The days of economic growth are back. The future belongs to those who can grow with it.\"\n",

Hard landing? More like no landing\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nInstitutions such as Bank of America and UBS have recently noted rising odds of a \\\"no landing\\\" outcome. In this scenario, US growth remains stronger than estimated, keeping inflation above target and interest rates elevated.\\n\\nConsider the amount of positive data points that have surprised investors recently.\\n\\nThere was September's blowout jobs print, which showed employers added a stunning 254,000 new positions and pulled the unemployment rate down to 4.1%.\\n\\nMeanwhile, recent GDP and gross domestic income revisions have also been \\\"overwhelmingly positive,\\\" BofA said, and this week's robust retail data shows that consumer spending has stayed strong, as real core control retail sales climbed 0.4%, compared to 0.1% in August and above estimates of 0.3%.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nBank of America\\n\\n\\\"This has led to fewer questions about downside risks and more on upside risks,\\\" BofA summarized in a Monday note.\\n\\nReacceleration could make investors uneasy, dashing hopes for swift rate cuts from the Fed. As inflation ticked up to 2.4% in September, odds of an upcoming half-point interest rate cut have tanked, and investors see 25 basis points as the most likely move in November.\\n\\nAccording to BofA, a no-landing scenario is bullish for stocks as long as inflation doesn't flare up again.\\n\\nThe trading playbook\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nHarris Financial Group's Jamie Cox told Business Insider that an inflation rebound is unlikely. In his view, inflation will continue to come down, allowing the Fed to lower rates gradually.\\n\\nPaired with strong GDP growth, investors should readjust expectations of how deep these rate cuts will be, the managing partner said.\\n\\nAccording to Cox, that means that short-term interest rates will drop to around 3% in the no landing scenario, even if long-term rates remain elevated.\\n\\nThat's good news for equities, as it will prompt money market investors and T-bill traders to move back into the stock market, he said.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAs this happens, high-dividend value sectors with strong cash flows will receive a boost. These include staples, utilities, and telecom. A steepening yield curve should also benefit financials.\\n\\n\\\"They're not going back and buying Nvidia, that money is not going back into Apple and all that kind of stuff,\\\" Cox said, referring to go-to tech names during the rate cycle's peak. \\\"You can see the flows of funds, you know, back into dividend-paying stocks. And that's why the market's broadening back out.\\\"\\n\\nMeanwhile, small caps can also expect to see upside, he said. The rate-sensitive sector has been under pressure in past years but was recently upgraded to neutral by Morgan Stanley. The bank said it would turn \\\"outright bullish\\\" on the sector if upward revisions to GDP continue, among other things.\\n\\nWhatever investors do, they shouldn't get bearish and sell.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAfter all, a no landing scenario is the best outcome for the economy, Cox said, and given hot growth, the situation effectively tosses recession fears out the window.\\n\\nThis would be just the fourth time in US history that the Fed has cut interest rates without a downturn, he added. In each case, markets were incredibly strong two to three years out, he said.\\n\\n\\\"[This scenario isn't] the base case for a lot of people who want bond yields and interest rates to drop a lot, and I think that people need to be careful about what they expect the Fed to do,\\\" the managing partner said. \\\"The rates are not going to drop as much as what people think, and that's okay; it's actually good.\\\"\"\n",

They overwhelmingly rejected a deal in September that had labor leaders\\u2019 blessing. This time, union negotiators aren\\u2019t endorsing the proposal.\\n\\nThe outcome of the vote, which needs a simple majority to pass, won\\u2019t be known until late in the day in Seattle, Boeing\\u2019s main manufacturing hub. That means investors, employees and executives will be left hanging for hours after the earnings, uncertain as to whether Boeing can finally start on the path to recovery \\u2014 or be forced to keep muddling through with anemic production and dwindling cash reserves.\\n\\nThe strike has become a defining episode for Ortberg, who inherited a set of interlocking crises when he took over in early August. He\\u2019s already announced a 10% workforce reduction that will sweep across all ranks of the planemaker, and he put together the first contours of a $25 billion refinancing package that aims to steady the company in the next three years.\\n\\n\\u201cIf there\\u2019s this perception that his first couple of months have been somewhat unblemished by success, this would be a terrific step in turning that around,\\u201d Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst at Aerodynamic Advisory LLC, said of the contract vote. \\u201cIt would de-risk an incredibly dangerous situation.\\u201d\\n\\nThe manufacturer faces the threat of its credit rating being cut to junk if the work stoppage drags on, a move that would increase borrowing costs and impede its access to capital. The squeeze extends to Boeing\\u2019s fragile supply chain, where any staffing cuts could hurt efforts to speed up factories again after the strife ends.\\n\\nOrtberg\\u2019s efforts to reset Boeing\\u2019s culture and relations with employees have been hurt by the strike. The announcement of job cuts, alongside a wide range of other measures, threatens to drive a wedge into the already fragile rapport between senior management and the shop floor.\\n\\nBoeing\\u2019s crisis of confidence extends not only to investors who have pushed down the stock by 41% this year. The company has been subject to whistleblower accounts recounting years of unauthorized work and defects that allege management prioritized production targets and financial goals over diligence and sound workmanship.\\n\\nCascading Crises\\n\\nThe new CEO, who joined out of retirement after cascading crises since the start of the year led to the departure of his predecessor, has sought to appeal to a sense of solidarity and common destiny. He\\u2019s also made a point of being closer to the action, buying a house in the Seattle area and spending more time on the factory shop floor.\\n\\nOrtberg has made clear he\\u2019s contemplating structural changes, telling employees that resources are spread too thin. The manufacturer could net as much as $20 billion selling an array of assets that aren\\u2019t essential to its main commercial and defense businesses, like its Jeppesen navigation subsidiary, analyst Cai von Rumohr of TD Cowen wrote in an Oct. 1 report.\\n\\nThe strike has exposed fault lines inside a company where senior executives long focused on returns, while Machinists saw their wages eaten up by inflation and their pension plan evaporate under a controversial 2014 contract. Many employees have therefore vowed hold out for a significantly better deal.\\n\\nThat\\u2019s why it\\u2019s not certain the latest overture, reached with the help of an encouraging nudge from the White House, will succeed. Leaders of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers District 751 didn\\u2019t provide a recommendation how members should vote on the tentative agreement, which doesn\\u2019t restore pensions.\\n\\nBoeing will unveil earnings before markets open in the US on Oct. 23. The company already disclosed some key metrics when it announced the planned job cuts on Oct. 11, including quarterly revenue that missed analyst estimates and $5 billion in charges related to different programs.\\n\\nTaking Time\\n\\nBoeing also said it had a cash outflow of $1.3 billion in the period, adding to the more than 7$ billion-drain in the preceding two quarters.\\n\\nWith the main results already out, Ortberg will have more leeway to address his plans for Boeing. The turnaround effort will be easier once the main commercial factories restart around Seattle, ending a walkout that has cost it about $100 million a day in lost revenue, by some estimates.\\n\\nStill, rebooting the assembly lines will be a gradual process, given the complexity of coordinating hundreds of thousands of parts while hiccups still ripple across the aerospace and defense supply chain.\\n\\nDouglas Harned, an analyst at Bernstein, said that even a strike resolution in late October would mean that deliveries of newly produced aircraft will essentially remain shut down going into November. If strikes in the past are any measure, a recovery will take time, he said.\\n\\n\\u201cBoeing is not going away,\\u201d Harned wrote in an Oct. 17 report. \\u201cBut, it is not clear today what the company will look like in five years.\\u201d\"\n",

With its assessment one step higher than major competitors, markets will watch for any cut in the outlook.\\n\\nAs for the biggest borrowers of all, the glimpse of the IMF\\u2019s report already published contains a grim admonishment: your public finances are everyone\\u2019s problem.\\n\\n\\u201cElevated debt levels and uncertainty surrounding fiscal policy in systemically important countries, such as China and the United States, can generate significant spillovers in the form of higher borrowing costs and debt-related risks in other economies,\\u201d the fund said.\\n\\nElsewhere in the coming week, a rate cut in Canada and a hike in Russia are among the possible central bank moves anticipated by economists.\\n\\nClick here for what happened in the past week, and below is our wrap of what\\u2019s coming up in the global economy.\\n\\nUS and Canada\\n\\nEconomists see a pair of home sales reports showing that declining mortgage rates are merely helping to stabilize the US residential real estate market. On Wednesday, the National Association of Realtors will issue data on contract closings for previously owned homes, followed a day later by government figures on sales of new homes.\\n\\nEconomists project modest increases in September sales of both existing and new homes. Resales remain hamstrung by limited inventory that\\u2019s keeping asking prices elevated and hurting affordability. While purchases of previously owned properties remain near the weakest pace since 2010, builders have capitalized: New-home sales have gradually picked up over the past two years with the help of incentives.\\n\\nOther US data in the coming week include September durable goods orders, plus capital goods shipments that will help economists fine-tune their estimates of third-quarter economic growth. The Federal Reserve also issues its Beige Book, an anecdotal readout of the economy.\\n\\nRegional Fed officials speaking in the coming week include Jeffrey Schmid, Mary Daly and Lorie Logan.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the Bank of Canada is increasingly expected to cut rates by 50 basis points after inflation cooled to 1.6% in September and some measures of the labor market remain weak.\\n\\nEurope, Middle East, Africa\\n\\nAs with other regions, attention will largely be focused on Washington; more than a dozen appearances of European Central Bank\\u2019s Governing Council members are scheduled stateside.\\n\\nThat includes President Christine Lagarde, who\\u2019ll be interviewed by Bloomberg Television\\u2019s Francine Lacqua in Washington on Tuesday.\\n\\nSimilarly, Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey will speak in New York on Tuesday, while Swiss National Bank President Martin Schlegel is scheduled to appear on Friday.\\n\\nAmong euro-area economic reports, consumer confidence on Wednesday, purchasing manager indexes the following day, and the ECB\\u2019s inflation expectations survey on Friday may be the highlights. Similarly, Germany\\u2019s Ifo Institute will release its closely watched business confidence gauge at the end of the week.\\n\\nAside from the possible rating assessment on France, S&P may also release reports on Belgium and Finland on Friday.\\n\\nTurning east, two central bank decisions are likely to draw attention, starting on Tuesday with Hungary, which may keep borrowing costs unchanged.\\n\\nThe Bank of Russia has signaled that continued inflationary pressures could lead to another rate hike on Friday. They lifted it 100 basis points to 19% in September, and a similar move would return the rate to the 20% level imposed in an emergency increase after President Vladimir Putin began the February 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\\n\\nFinally, data on Wednesday from South Africa is expected to show inflation slowed to 3.8% in September, boosting the chances of another rate cut next month. The central bank said it now forecasts consumer-price growth to stay in the bottom half of its 3% to 6% target band over the next three quarters.\\n\\nAsia\\n\\nLenders in China, with a nudge from the People\\u2019s Bank of China, are expected to join the campaign to revive business activity by trimming their loan prime rates on Monday. The 1-year and 5-year rates are seen sliding by 20 basis points to 3.15% and 3.65%, respectively.\\n\\nAt the end of the week, data will show if the nation\\u2019s industrial profits bounced back in September after slumping more than 17% in August. The most recent numbers showed the economy expanding at the lowest pace in six quarters during that three-month period.\\n\\nElsewhere, the region gets a cluster of PMIs on Thursday, including from Japan, Australia and India.\\n\\nSingapore is forecast to report Wednesday that consumer inflation slowed in September, with price growth updates for that month also due from Hong Kong and Malaysia.\\n\\nOn Friday, Japan will report Tokyo CPI for October, a key indicator that will capture corporate price changes at the start of the fiscal second half.\\n\\nSouth Korea will release third-quarter growth figures on Wednesday that may show the economy\\u2019s momentum has slowed marginally.\\n\\nDuring the week, South Korea releases early trade statistics for October, with Taiwan and New Zealand releasing trade numbers for September.\\n\\nAmong the region\\u2019s central banks, many leading officials will attend the IMF meetings in Washington. Reserve Bank of Australia Deputy Governor Andrew Hauser holds a fireside chat on Monday, and three days later the bank publishes its annual report.\\n\\nReserve Bank of New Zealand chief Adrian Orr speaks on policy on the sidelines of the IMF confab, and Uzbekistan\\u2019s central bank will decide Thursday whether to pause for a second meeting following its July rate cut.\\n\\nLatin America\\n\\nBrazil watchers will be keen to see the weekly forecasts in the central bank\\u2019s so-called Focus survey due on Monday.\\n\\nExpectations for inflation, borrowing costs and debt metrics have lately taken a decidedly gloomy turn given doubts about the government\\u2019s fiscal discipline.\\n\\nIn Mexico, GDP proxy data should be consistent with the loss of momentum that has many economists marking down their third-quarter growth forecasts. The economy is expected to slow for a third year in 2024.\\n\\nGDP proxy data for Argentina will probably show South America\\u2019s second-biggest economy sputtering and still in the grip of a recession that\\u2019s likely to extend into 2025.\\n\\nParaguay\\u2019s central bank holds its rate setting meeting; policymakers have kept borrowing costs at 6% for the past six months with inflation running slightly above the 4% target.\\n\\nOn the prices front, neither investors nor policymakers will be cheered by mid-month inflation reports from Brazil and Mexico given the early consensus for higher headline readings.\\n\\nThe data here will likely do nothing to dent the prospects of Brazil\\u2019s central bank tightening policy again on Nov. 6, while at the same time giving Banxico pause about a third straight cut at its Nov. 14 gathering.\"\n",

      "            \"text\": \"European company executives might be even more preoccupied than their US counterparts about Donald Trump\\u2019s promise to impose tariffs on all imports if he retakes the White House.\\n\\nMentions of \\u201ctariff\\u201d on earnings conference calls so far this period have soared in Europe, outpacing instances on US calls by a ratio of 5 to 2 in October. By far, the characterizations are negative. The chief financial officer of French spirits maker Pernod Ricard said the company will \\u201cadapt\\u201d to global tariffs when there is more clarity. Volvo Car AB\\u2019s chief executive officer said trade levies are complicating the outlook for profitability.\\n\\nThere\\u2019s good reason for all the consternation over a word the Republican candidate has declared \\u201cbeautiful\\u201d and his favorite in the dictionary. Investors and market strategists see a Trump victory as the worst outcome for European equities because of his intention to restrict imports into the US. America is the European Union\\u2019s largest trading partner by far, with total trade amounting to $952 billion in 2023, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\\n\\nA raft of Wall Street economists have warned that Trump\\u2019s tariff-hike plans will send inflation higher and curb economic growth, particularly if US trading partners retaliate. A Morgan Stanley model indicated a 0.9 percentage point bump in inflation over 12 months, and a 1.4 percentage-point hit to GDP growth over several quarters.\\n\\n\\u201cIf tariff threats come in hard and fast, and Europe retaliates with its own counter tariffs, we will look back at the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act passed in the 1930s which worsened the Great Depression,\\u201d said Rajeev De Mello, chief investment officer at Gama Asset Management. \\u201cThat would be very negative for European equities.\\u201d\\n\\nMeanwhile, potential tax increases under a Democrat Kamala Harris administration could give European stocks the edge. That\\u2019s because they would take a bite out of S&P 500 company earnings, potentially eroding their attractiveness to investors.\\n\\nEuropean stocks are lagging far behind their US peers this year. The earnings season is off to a shaky start, and there are major doubts over whether China\\u2019s stimulus efforts can boost the region\\u2019s faltering economy. US voters are already casting early ballots for next month\\u2019s too-close-to-call election, and the potential return of Trump would add to the list of headwinds.\\n\\nRepresentatives for the Harris and Trump campaigns declined to comment.\\n\\nTrump has proclaimed that he would target countries like China with tariffs of anywhere from 60% to 100%, with a 10% across-the-board levy on imports from elsewhere. These may yet prove to be opening positions for negotiation, but memories are still fresh of the effect a strategy like that can have on companies and stocks.\\n\\n\\u201cIn the event of a Trump victory, you would want to be long US small caps and you probably want to be short European companies that depend on exporting to consumers,\\u201d said Guy Stear, head of developed markets strategy at the Amundi Investment Institute. \\u201cThese companies have done poorly over the past three to six months and can continue to do poorly.\\u201d\\n\\nEuropean equities trailed their US counterparts in local currency terms in all the years Trump was president, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The mining sector came under particular pressure in 2018 as the then-president hit European steel and aluminum exports with tariffs.\\n\\n\\u201cIn a worst-case scenario of a full-blown tariff war with retaliation, we estimate potential for a mid to high single-digit drag on European earnings-per-share growth,\\u201d Barclays Plc strategists led by Emmanuel Cau wrote in a note. A \\u201cbig chunk\\u201d of consensus forecasts of more than 10% growth in earnings next year could be wiped out by a spat over levies on trade, they said.\\n\\nRead more: EU Readies US Trade Targets If Election Brings Trump Tariffs\\n\\nBy country, Germany and Italy look most at risk given their higher goods surplus with the US, according to the Barclays team. Among sectors, capital goods, automotives, beverages, technology, and chemicals face the greatest threat.\\n\\nWhen it comes to taxes, Trump has promised to cut the federal corporate rate to 15% from 21%, a move that would be a boost for US stocks, while Harris proposes raising it to 28%. But tariffs are the issue uppermost on the minds of executives outside the US, as these are in the purview of the President, while any changes in tax policy require the approval of Congress.\\n\\n\\u201cA newly elected Mr. Trump could theoretically have a lot of power to assess in short order,\\u201d said Carol Schleif, chief investment officer at BMO Family Office. \\u201cHe has effectively put the EU, China, and other manufacturers on notice that if one wants to sell to US citizens, the products or services should be produced \\u2014 not just assembled \\u2014 in the US.\\u201d\\n\\nRead more: Euro Parity Threat Is Back on Trump Tariffs Risk, ECB Cuts\\n\\nA tariff onslaught from a Trump Presidency is the last thing Europe\\u2019s auto sector needs right now. Volkswagen AG, Mercedes-Benz Group AG and BMW AG have all just reported a slump in sales in the key China market, while Jeep maker Stellantis NV has joined its peers in slashing its profit forecast. It\\u2019s the worst-performing Stoxx 600 sector in 2024.\\n\\nTrump has vowed to boost the US auto industry by making interest on car loans fully tax-deductible. He has also said he would prevent cars made by China across the border in Mexico from being sold in America, imposing \\u201cwhatever tariffs are required\\u201d to do so \\u2014 even as high as 1,000%.\\n\\n\\u201cThe additional tariffs on China imports could see a second-order negative effect on European stocks exposed to China, like materials and autos, although the sentiment toward these segments is already quite depressed,\\u201d said Leonardo Pellandini, equity strategist at Bank Julius Baer.\\n\\nStill, there are some sectors that could benefit from Trump\\u2019s policies. Oddo BHF strategist Thomas Zlowodzki said media as well as oil and oil services are likely to be supported. In the case of a Harris win, the strategist said the sectors to play are metals, aerospace and defense as well as capital goods.\\n\\nThe Stoxx Europe 600 is expected to climb nearly 2% by the end of the year, according to a Bloomberg survey of strategists. But the US elections are seen as a wild card. UBS Group AG strategist Gerry Fowler said rising risk premia and potential tariffs may mean that European banks, the best-performing subgroup this year with a gain of 23%, would be among the most vulnerable sectors, and investors should consider hedging.\\n\\nWith the vote outcome this unclear, one thing is certain: investors should prepare for volatility in the build-up to Nov. 5. Citigroup Inc. strategists led by Beata Manthey advise caution and waiting before returning to sectors that should benefit from economic growth.\\n\\n\\u201cBased on Trump\\u2019s first term, it could well be that the tariff threat is a negotiating tactic and we avoid a tariff escalation,\\u201d Gama\\u2019s De Mello said. \\u201cThe more credible his threat, the more likely he could get concessions, so the initial phase could be rough.\\u201d\"\n",

      "            \"text\": \"While I am years out of high school, my memories of crumbling under its demands remain sharp in my mind. After returning from cross-country practice in the evening and speeding through dinner to crack the textbooks awaiting me, tears would often fall on my pages under the pressure\\u2014self-inflicted, social, and familial\\u2014to be perfect by achieving the highest grades, exceeding in every class and extracurricular, and getting into the best college.\\n\\nToday, teens are under that same pressure\\u2014if not more, thanks to the added weight of social-media comparison\\u2014and we know much more about how detrimental that can be to their mental health.\\n\\nThat obsession with success is a topic that piqued the interest of journalist Jennifer Breheny Wallace, mom to kids ages 19, 17, and 14. She began to research the topic when her eldest son was in eighth grade, and published her findings in a book published last year, Never Enough: When Achievement Culture Becomes Toxic\\u2014And What We Can Do About It.\\n\\n\\u201cAchievement is not the problem,\\u201d Wallace tells Fortune she learned. \\u201cIt\\u2019s the way that we\\u2019ve come to talk about achievement.\\u201d\\n\\nIn the most extreme cases, teens turn to substance abuse, isolation, depression, and suicidal thoughts when they feel under constant pressure to achieve and believe they cannot live up to it.\\n\\nBut after doing two national surveys of over 6,000 parents and 500 young adults as part of her research, Wallace uncovered patterns crucial to ensuring kids can be successful, both academically and mentally, and on the path to becoming well-adjusted adults. Below, some of Wallace\\u2019s advice about how parents can provide shelter from the storm of toxic teenage pressures.\\n\\nShow your kids the joy you feel from being their parent\\n\\nWallace says one of the first things parents can do is make home a \\u201chaven\\u201d from the pressures they feel at school and on social media to constantly achieve.\\n\\nTo do that, minimize criticism and prioritize affection, Wallace says. She uses the phrase \\u201cgreet them like the family dog greets you\\u201d when they get home: In other words, show them the pure joy you get just from being their parent. Instead of immediately asking them how they performed on a test the moment they walk through the door, she says, ask them how they\\u2019re doing.\\n\\nThat turns home into \\u201ca place our kids never feel like they have to perform a certain way to be lovable to us,\\u201d Wallace tells Fortune.\\n\\nHelp them see that they matter outside of achievement\\n\\nOne of the biggest takeaways Wallace found in her research was the importance of \\u201cmattering.\\u201d This is when children feel like they are valued and that they add value to the world around them, she explains. That feeling should transcend test scores, where they go to college, what they look like, and what kind of accolades they receive.\\n\\n\\u201cWe love our kids unconditionally, but they don\\u2019t always feel like we regard them unconditionally,\\u201d Wallace says.\\n\\nShe noticed that kids who struggled most felt their purpose was contingent on performance\\u2014causing them to shy away from taking big risks out of a fear of failure that would take away their value.\\n\\nBut how do you help your kids feel like they matter? By getting to know them, Wallace says. Show them that they add value to the world because of who they are at their core. She says even by noticing the little things about them\\u2014how funny they can be, little quirks about them that you love\\u2014you show them you value their whole person, not just their measurable achievements.\\n\\nWhen children feel like they matter, Wallace says, it acts as a \\u201cprotective shield,\\u201d and often has the added benefit of allowing them to be more successful. They\\u2019re willing to strive for bigger goals knowing they matter outside of the outcomes of them, she says.\\n\\n\\u201cThrough mattering\\u2026we give our kids a kind of healthy fuel that propels them to achieve, and to achieve for things that mean more than just individual success and resume building,\\u201d Wallace says. \\u201cIt sets our kids up to find purpose.\\u201d\\n\\nFor help in getting to know your child, Wallace recommends the Values in Action survey, which can guide parents and kids to better understand their unique character strengths.\\n\\n\\u201cSignal to kids that you believe they can do this,\\u201d Wallace says. And if they can\\u2019t, she adds, make sure they know your love doesn\\u2019t waver. \\u201cThe primary job of a parent is to support a kid\\u2019s development of sense of self.\\u201d\\n\\nBe their biggest supporter\\n\\nAlso crucial is to not let your own frustrations negatively impact interactions around their schoolwork.\\n\\nIf your child is struggling, instead of getting frustrated with them, start to investigate any underlying reasons, Wallace suggests. Are they having a difficult time socially? Is their workspace at home too distracting?\\n\\nWallace says parents can help kids focus on getting work done at home by creating a plan with them, rather than only focusing on the outcomes of their work. That is often easier when parents lean into their kids\\u2019 strengths while getting involved in the process. Parents are often wired to focus on what\\u2019s going wrong, she says, not what they are already doing well.\\n\\nBut, Wallace says, it\\u2019s important to \\u201clet your child know you\\u2019re on their team,\\u201d and that means helping them focus on their strengths.\\n\\nBe mindful of how you share input\\n\\nHow you communicate your frustrations is crucial, too. If you do get upset with them, Wallace says to make sure you \\u201cseparate the deed from the doer.\\u201d You might not like what they did, but you have to make sure they know you still love them.\\n\\n\\u201cThat is really one of the most challenging things for a parent,\\u201d Wallace acknowledges, especially when you\\u2019re tired, stressed, and lacking bandwidth. Take a beat and get yourself in the right frame of mind to express how you feel, so your kids know you don\\u2019t think they are bad, even if their behavior is.\\n\\nBe aware of status anxiety\\n\\nFor millennials who felt the financial strain and economic uncertainty from the 2008 recession and are now parents themselves, Wallace says they have started \\u201csafeguarding\\u201d their children\\u2019s economic futures by pushing for them to go to prestigious colleges. That is what she calls \\u201cstatus anxiety,\\u201d in which parents impose pressure on their children out of fear that they will face economic hardship if they aren\\u2019t high-achievers.\\n\\nWhat that\\u2019s resulted in, Wallace says, is additional stress that kids don\\u2019t need.\\n\\nIf you might be subconsciously externalizing status anxiety in how you talk to your children, the first step is to reflect and get aware, Wallace says. The next: Get clear on your values.\\n\\nWallace says the best way to combat this is to make sure both you and your children are not surrounded by messages that activate status-seeking extrinsic values, such as finding worth in high test scores, a high income, and appearance-driven behaviors.\\n\\nShe recommends taking a hard look at your own calendar first\\u2014are you prioritizing things that bring you intrinsic satisfaction, like family dinners and time with friends? Wallace says you want to model the behavior that ensures your children won\\u2019t prioritize the pursuit of extrinsic goals, which can lead to an absence of mattering and self-worth if values come from goals surrounding status over meaningful purpose.\\n\\nTake a look at their calendars too, she says, to see what sort of values they are spending their time on.\\n\\nDon\\u2019t forget to take care of yourself\\n\\nParents are under a lot of pressure too, says Wallace. The Surgeon General\\u2019s most recent advisory on parental well-being highlighted financial strain, isolation and loneliness, and cultural pressures as just a few of the factors causing the current mental health crisis for parents.\\n\\nIn Wallace\\u2019s survey conducted with Harvard (published in her book) of over 6,000 parents from early 2020, 83% of parents somewhat or strongly agreed that their children\\u2019s academic success is a reflection of their parenting. And now, they might be panicking as they try to balance worrying about their children\\u2019s futures with not being too overbearing in supporting their kids\\u2019 success.\\n\\nBut if there\\u2019s one takeaway Wallace has for parents trying to manage their own stress, it\\u2019s this: \\u201cNever worry alone.\\u201d\\n\\nInstead, prioritize a strong support network, which can be built by getting clear on your values. Because not only will valuing meaningful relationships lessen parental isolation through a strong support system, says Wallace, it will model intrinsic values and healthy behaviors for your children.\\n\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s never been harder to be a parent,\\u201d she says. \\u201cYou are worthy of support\\u2026of surrounding yourself with people who value you.\\u201d\\n\\nMore on teens and mental health:\"\n",

Before it premiered, some theorized that their identity was the American computer programmer Len Sassaman, who died in 2011.\\n\\nSatoshi Nakamoto being deceased would potentially soothe a big fear that's loomed over the bitcoin market for years, which is that the person could sell their estimated 1 million bitcoin.\\n\\nThat is a substantial percentage of the 21 million bitcoin that will ever exist, and such a massive sale was long feared as a bearish event for the token.\\n\\nIf Satoshi did not leave proper instructions to transfer the assets upon their death, then the fixed supply of 21 million bitcoins is probably closer to 20 million.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nSean Farrell, head of digital assets strategy at Fundstrat, highlighted this dynamic in a note earlier this month.\\n\\n\\\"There's a slight upside risk if they identify someone who is deceased, as this would effectively 'burn' Satoshi's supply for good,\\\" Farrell said.\\n\\n\\\"Bitcoin's true float is undoubtedly below 21 million,\\\" Farrell told Business Insider. \\\"This is something that we all know to be true but is nearly impossible to verify.\\\"\\n\\nThat's also because losing bitcoin is relatively easy even when you're still alive.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nLost bitcoin essentially \\\"burns\\\" it, decreasing the amount available for investors to purchase and reinforcing a basic economic principle: less supply means higher prices with constant or increasing demand.\\n\\nFarrell estimates that about 1.5 million bitcoins, or about 7.5% of the total supply, could be deemed \\\"probably lost\\\" because they haven't moved since the launch of the first bitcoin exchange in 2010, about one year after bitcoin was created.\\n\\nA story in The New Yorker in 2021 profiled a man in Wales who lost a trove of bitcoin that, at that time, was worth around $500 million when he accidentally threw a hard drive containing his bitcoin stash in the dump.\\n\\n\\\"It is probably only with the passage of time that we can get a sense for just how much of the bitcoin supply has been lost,\\\" Farrell said.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nSophisticated investors who own a large amount of bitcoin often store the cryptocurrency on encrypted cold wallets to protect against hacks.\\n\\nIn these cases, that means the bitcoin is not held on an exchange like Coinbase, which has a recovery process for family members of deceased customers.\\n\\nRather, it's typically held on a physical USB drive that could look meaningless to an unassuming eye and get easily lost or looked over in the shuffle of cleaning up an estate.\\n\\nBitcoin's decentralized nature means no bank or authority can access or recover the assets without the private key to the wallet or hard drive.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\\"Unlike traditional financial accounts, there is no institution to contact to recover your cryptocurrency. If no one has your private key, the funds will be locked permanently,\\\" Wealthica CEO Eric Lemieux told Business Insider.\\n\\nHe added: \\\"If you store your bitcoin in a cold wallet and die without giving someone access to your private recovery keys or recovery phrases, the bitcoin could be lost forever.\\\"\\n\\nLemieux said it is imperative for bitcoin investors who hold the asset on a cold wallet to ensure that their estate planning \\\"includes your private key or recovery phrase through a lawyer or encrypted document stored securely.\\\"\\n\\nOtherwise, more lost bitcoin could mean even higher prices for the crypto.\"\n",

    "We see this model hasnt performed well in predicting the return of the index. Ideally I would have a longer lookback period but this is limited by the newsapi free tier. I would also like to have access to LLM models that allow for lager token spend, ie I can put the whole news article in and analyse that instead of a summary. I had investigated chunking up the text, summarising each bit and then combining the summaries together before summarising the combined summaries. However this proved computationaly exhausting. The built nlp summarizer of newspaper3k offered a nice alternative to this. Its not perfect but it can provide a good summary.\n",

    "The sentiment analysis with finbert from HuggingFace similarly was good but not ideal. It didnt allow for much prompt engineering. It simply analysed the whole prompt and so if i had asked it to 'provide sentiment analysis on the fear of recession' it provided very negative results on the account of the phrase 'fear of recession'. Therefore prompt engineering couldnt be fully explored here.\n",
    "\n",
    "If i had a model that could accept the large text and was quick, we prompt it with 'You are a sentiment analysis machine, tasked with providing a quantitative result regarding the fear of recession. You are too focus on common indicators and phrases that describe economic health.
