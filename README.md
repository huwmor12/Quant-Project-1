# Quant-Project-1

These Jupyter Notebooks work through a number of key concepts within finance and quantitative finance. They are intended to show my knowledge and understanding, whilst demonstrating my passion for learning as these are all selftaught.

I began by coding some key technical indicators, including SMA, Bollinger bands, MACD, RSI and ADX. I exploreed the maths and applied them to real historical data. 

I then created a trading algorithm based off a Mean Reversion with Bollinger bands. We backtested on real historical data. We then added a momentum indicator to qualify the entry points of the base Mean Reversion strategy to see if we saw any imporovement on performance.

Then next notebook explores a time series analysis of the S&P 500, where we tested and identifiedd correlated and cointegrated pairs that would be suitable for a pairs trading strategy. We backtested this in the necxt notbeook.

We add a Stop-Loss to a simple cross-over startegy. It slightly improves the risk associated metrics.

I have also created a sentiment analysis based model that analyses the headlines and profit earnings calls of companies to try and gauge how the market is feeling, specifically about recession.
